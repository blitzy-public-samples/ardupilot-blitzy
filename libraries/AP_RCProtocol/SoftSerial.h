 * @brief Software serial byte reconstruction from pulse timing measurements
 * 
 * @details This file implements a software UART decoder that reconstructs serial
 *          byte streams from pulse width measurements. Used by RC protocol backends
 *          (SBUS, iBus, DSM, SRXL) to decode serial data from pulse train inputs.
 *          
 *          The implementation uses half-bit timing analysis to sample pulse widths
 *          at appropriate intervals, detecting start bits, accumulating data bits,
 *          validating stop bits, and optionally checking parity to reconstruct
 *          complete serial bytes from the timing measurements.
 * 
 * @note This software UART implementation is critical for RC receiver protocols
 *       that transmit serial data over pulse-width encoded channels.

/**
 * @class SoftSerial
 * @brief Software UART decoder for reconstructing serial bytes from pulse timing
 * 
 * @details This utility class implements a software serial decoder that converts
 *          pulse width measurements (state0/state1 timing) into serial byte streams.
 *          It reconstructs UART framing by analyzing pulse durations to extract:
 *          - Start bit detection
 *          - Data bit accumulation (8 bits)
 *          - Parity bit validation (for even parity configurations)
 *          - Stop bit verification
 *          - Signal inversion handling (for inverted serial modes)
 *          
 *          Algorithm: Uses half-bit timing windows to sample pulse widths at precise
 *          intervals. Each pulse duration (width_s0 and width_s1) is divided by the
 *          half_bit period to determine how many bit periods elapsed, allowing
 *          reconstruction of the serial bit stream from timing measurements.
 *          
 *          Used by multiple RC protocol backends:
 *          - SBUS: 100000 baud, 8E2 inverted (8-bit even parity 2 stop bits)
 *          - DSM: 115200 baud, 8N1 (8-bit no parity 1 stop bit)
 *          - SRXL: 115200 baud, 8N1
 *          - iBus: 115200 baud, 8N1
 * 
 * @warning Requires precise pulse width measurements with <1% timing error for
 *          reliable byte reconstruction. Timing jitter or measurement inaccuracy
 *          will cause byte framing errors and data corruption.
 * 
 * @note This class maintains minimal state between pulse processing calls,
 *       accumulating bits progressively until a complete byte is received.

     *          1. Converts pulse widths to bit periods using half-bit timing:
     *             bit_count = (pulse_width_us + half_bit/2) / half_bit

     *          
     *          3. Accumulates data bits by tracking bit offset through the pulse train
     *          
     *          4. Validates stop bits to ensure proper byte framing
     *

     *          
     *          6. Applies signal inversion for inverted configurations (8E2I, 8N1I)
     *          
     *          The state machine maintains bit_ofs to track position within the current byte
     *          being reconstructed, accumulating bits progressively across multiple pulse
     *          measurements until a complete byte (start + 8 data + parity + stop) is received.
     * 
     * @param[in]  width_s0 Duration of state0 (low) pulse in microseconds
     * @param[in]  width_s1 Duration of state1 (high) pulse in microseconds
     * @param[out] b        Reconstructed serial byte (valid only when method returns true)

     * @note This method is called repeatedly with consecutive pulse measurements.
     *       State is maintained internally between calls to accumulate bits progressively.
