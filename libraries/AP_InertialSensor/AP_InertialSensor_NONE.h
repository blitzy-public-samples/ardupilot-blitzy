 * @brief Null IMU backend for boards without physical sensors
 * 
 * @details This file implements a stub IMU backend for platforms without physical
 *          IMU hardware, typically embedded companion computers or peripheral CAN nodes.
 *          It provides a minimal functional IMU interface that allows the system to
 *          boot successfully and establish connectivity (WiFi, MAVLink) without actual
 *          sensor hardware.
 * 
 *          This implementation is derived from the SITL backend with all simulation
 *          logic removed and replaced with constant zero values.
 * 
 * @note Only compiled for ESP32 platform (CONFIG_HAL_BOARD == HAL_BOARD_ESP32)
 * @note Used primarily in AP_Periph firmware for peripheral nodes
 * 
 * @warning This backend provides no valid sensor data - for peripheral/development use only
 * @warning Flight control is impossible with this backend - vehicle will fail pre-arm checks

/**
 * @class AP_InertialSensor_NONE
 * @brief Null backend for IMU-less platforms
 * 
 * @details Minimal IMU backend providing stub sensor interface for platforms
 *          without physical IMU hardware. This backend allows the ArduPilot
 *          system to initialize successfully on boards like ESP32 that serve
 *          as peripheral nodes or companion computers without requiring actual
 *          gyroscope or accelerometer hardware.
 *          
 *          Functionality provided:
 *          - Zero sensor readings (all axes return 0.0)
 *          - Proper backend registration for system initialization
 *          - Simulated update timing matching Pixhawk1 rates
 *          - No hardware initialization or polling
 *          - Always reports unhealthy status to prevent flight use
 *          
 *          Primary use cases:
 *          - ESP32 peripheral nodes (AP_Periph firmware)
 *          - Companion computers without IMU hardware
 *          - Development/testing environments without hardware
 *          - Firmware variants that don't require IMU (non-flight applications)
 *          
 *          Backend behavior:
 *          - get_gyro() returns Vector3f(0, 0, 0) for all axes
 *          - get_accel() returns Vector3f(0, 0, 0) for all axes
 *          - get_gyro_health() returns false (unhealthy status)
 *          - get_accel_health() returns false (unhealthy status)
 *          - update() performs timing management but generates no real data
 *          - Maintains sample timing to prevent scheduler issues
 *          
 *          Integration with vehicle code:
 *          - Automatically registered when no physical IMU detected on ESP32
 *          - Vehicle code must check IMU health before using data
 *          - Pre-arm checks will fail, preventing flight operations
 *          - Allows MAVLink communication and parameter management
 * 
 * @note Backend is automatically selected on ESP32 boards without IMU hardware
 * @note Inherits from AP_InertialSensor_Backend for standard IMU interface
 * @note Sample rates match Pixhawk1 (1000 Hz) for scheduler compatibility
 * 
 * @warning Flight control is impossible without valid IMU data
 * @warning This backend is for peripheral nodes and development only
 * @warning Vehicle will fail all pre-arm checks with this backend
 * @warning Do not use on flight-critical systems
 * 
 * @see AP_InertialSensor_Backend for base class interface
 * @see AP_InertialSensor for main sensor manager
