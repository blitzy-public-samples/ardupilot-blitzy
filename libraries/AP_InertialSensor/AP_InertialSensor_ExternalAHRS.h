/**
 * @class AP_InertialSensor_ExternalAHRS
 * @brief Backend adapter for external AHRS IMU data
 * 
 * @details Adapter layer allowing external AHRS systems to provide IMU data:
 *          - Receives IMU packets from external AHRS systems
 *          - Translates external data to AP_InertialSensor internal format
 *          - Registers as regular IMU backend for seamless integration
 *          - Supports multiple external AHRS sources simultaneously
 *          
 *          Supported external AHRS systems:
 *          - VectorNav VN-100/200/300 series
 *          - Lord MicroStrain 3DM-GX5/CV5 series
 *          - Custom MAVLink IMU data sources
 *          - Other systems via AP_ExternalAHRS framework
 *          
 *          Data flow architecture:
 *          1. External AHRS sends IMU data via serial/CAN/Ethernet
 *          2. AP_ExternalAHRS parses protocol-specific packets
 *          3. Parsed data passed to handle_external() method
 *          4. Driver publishes to frontend as native IMU samples
 *          5. EKF and attitude controllers consume as normal IMU
 *          
 *          Primary use cases:
 *          - High-end navigation-grade IMUs with superior performance
 *          - Pre-filtered/fused IMU data from external processors
 *          - Offloading sensor fusion to dedicated hardware
 *          - Integration with existing AHRS infrastructure
 *          - Testing with simulation or logged IMU data sources
 *          
 *          Thread safety:
 *          - handle_external() called from protocol parser thread
 *          - update() called from main scheduler loop
 *          - Synchronization handled by frontend accumulator
 * 
 * @note Requires AP_EXTERNAL_AHRS_ENABLED compile flag to be set
 * @note External IMU bypasses standard calibration - assumes pre-calibrated data
 * @warning Latency and jitter from external source affects control loop performance
 * @warning Ensure external AHRS coordinate frame matches ArduPilot conventions (NED)
 * 
 * @see AP_ExternalAHRS for protocol parsing and configuration
 * @see AP_InertialSensor_Backend for base backend interface
