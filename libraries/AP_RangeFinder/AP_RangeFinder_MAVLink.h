 * @brief MAVLink rangefinder backend for remote distance sensors
 * 
 * @details This header defines the AP_RangeFinder_MAVLink class, which implements
 *          a rangefinder backend that receives distance measurements via MAVLink
 *          DISTANCE_SENSOR messages. This enables integration of remote rangefinders
 *          connected to companion computers, external flight controllers, or other
 *          MAVLink-capable systems.
 *          
 *          The backend processes MAVLink DISTANCE_SENSOR messages (message ID 132)
 *          and extracts distance, min/max range, and sensor type information. This
 *          allows ArduPilot to use rangefinders that are not directly connected to
 *          the flight controller hardware.
 *          
 *          Common use cases:
 *          - Companion computer interfacing custom distance sensors
 *          - Secondary flight controller sharing rangefinder data
 *          - ROS nodes publishing distance measurements
 *          - External vision systems providing obstacle distance
 * 
 * @note This backend is enabled when AP_RANGEFINDER_MAVLINK_ENABLED is defined
 * @see AP_RangeFinder_Backend for base class interface

/**
 * @class AP_RangeFinder_MAVLink
 * @brief Rangefinder backend for receiving distance measurements via MAVLink protocol
 * 
 * @details This class implements a rangefinder backend that receives distance sensor
 *          data through MAVLink DISTANCE_SENSOR messages rather than directly reading
 *          hardware sensors. This enables "virtual" rangefinder integration where the
 *          actual sensor is connected to a remote system (companion computer, secondary
 *          flight controller, or external processor) that forwards measurements via
 *          MAVLink telemetry.
 *          
 *          **Architecture**:
 *          - Inherits from AP_RangeFinder_Backend for standard rangefinder interface
 *          - Receives DISTANCE_SENSOR messages (MAVLink message ID 132) via handle_msg()
 *          - Stores distance, min/max range, and sensor type from messages
 *          - Implements timeout checking to detect stale data
 *          - Provides standard update() interface for rangefinder state management
 *          
 *          **MAVLink Integration**:
 *          The backend processes DISTANCE_SENSOR messages containing:
 *          - current_distance: Current distance measurement (cm)
 *          - min_distance: Minimum measurable distance (cm)
 *          - max_distance: Maximum measurable distance (cm)
 *          - type: Sensor type (MAV_DISTANCE_SENSOR enum)
 *          - signal_quality: Optional signal quality indicator (0-100%)
 *          
 *          **Lifecycle**:
 *          1. detect() called during rangefinder initialization
 *          2. Constructor initializes backend with rangefinder state reference
 *          3. handle_msg() called when DISTANCE_SENSOR messages arrive
 *          4. update() called periodically to check for timeouts
 *          5. max_distance() and min_distance() queried by rangefinder library
 *          
 *          **Use Cases**:
 *          - Companion computer running custom sensor drivers
 *          - ROS nodes publishing range measurements to ArduPilot
 *          - External vision systems providing obstacle distances
 *          - Secondary flight controllers sharing sensor data
 *          - Network-connected rangefinders via MAVLink routing
 * 
 * @note This backend always reports as "detected" since presence is indicated
 *       by user configuration rather than hardware probing
 * @warning Ensure MAVLink message frequency is >2Hz to avoid timeout
 * @see AP_RangeFinder_Backend for base class interface
 * @see MAVLink DISTANCE_SENSOR message definition (message ID 132)

     *          Unlike physical sensors (I2C, serial, analog), MAVLink rangefinders

     *          Unlike hardware sensors that actively read during update(), MAVLink

     *          matches this rangefinder's sensor ID.
     *          
     *          **Message Processing**:
     *          1. Validate message type is DISTANCE_SENSOR (ID 132)
     *          2. Extract distance measurement from current_distance field
     *          3. Store min_distance and max_distance sensor capabilities

     *          
     *          **Remote Rangefinder Integration**:
     *          This method enables complete integration of rangefinders connected to
     *          external systems. The remote system (companion computer, ROS node,
     *          secondary flight controller) reads the physical sensor and publishes
