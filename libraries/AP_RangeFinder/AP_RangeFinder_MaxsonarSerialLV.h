 * @file AP_RangeFinder_MaxsonarSerialLV.h
 * @brief MaxBotix MaxSonar-LV ultrasonic rangefinder backend using ASCII serial protocol
 * 
 * @details This driver implements support for the MaxBotix MB1xxx series Serial LV 
 *          (Low Voltage) ultrasonic rangefinders. These are low-cost distance sensors
 *          that output ASCII formatted range data over a serial connection (typically UART).
 *          
 *          The MB1xxx-LV series uses a simple ASCII protocol where each reading is sent
 *          as a text string containing the range value. This driver parses these ASCII
 *          messages to extract distance measurements.
 *          
 *          Sensor Characteristics:
 *          - Detection Range: Typically 0-5 to 0-6 meters depending on model
 *          - Resolution: 1cm
 *          - Update Rate: 6-10 Hz depending on configuration
 *          - Interface: TTL Serial (3.3V or 5V depending on model)
 *          - Protocol: ASCII text output (e.g., "R0125\r" for 125cm)
 *          
 *          Supported Models: MB1000, MB1010, MB1020, MB1030, MB1040, and other MB1xxx-LV variants
 *          
 *          Connection: Connect to any available serial port configured as a rangefinder.
 *          
 * @note The "LV" designation indicates these are the Low Voltage (3.3V/5V TTL serial)
 *       versions, distinct from the analog output or RS232 variants.
 * 
 * @warning This driver expects ASCII formatted output. Ensure the sensor is configured
 *          for serial ASCII output mode, not analog or PWM output modes.
 * 
 * @see AP_RangeFinder_Backend_Serial for the serial backend base class
 * @see https://www.maxbotix.com for sensor datasheets and specifications

 * @class AP_RangeFinder_MaxsonarSerialLV
 * @brief Driver for MaxBotix MaxSonar-LV ultrasonic rangefinders with ASCII serial output
 * 
 * @details This class implements the rangefinder backend for MaxBotix MB1xxx-LV series
 *          ultrasonic distance sensors that communicate via ASCII serial protocol.
 *          
 *          The driver reads ASCII formatted distance data from the serial port, parses
 *          the messages, and extracts range measurements. The MB1xxx-LV sensors output
 *          simple ASCII strings containing range values, typically in the format:
 *          "Rxxxx\r" where xxxx is the range in centimeters.
 *          
 *          Protocol Details:
 *          - Message Format: ASCII text string starting with 'R' followed by digits
 *          - Example Output: "R0125\r" indicates 125cm distance
 *          - Line Termination: Carriage return (\r)
 *          - Baud Rate: Typically 9600 (configurable via parameters)
 *          - Update Rate: Continuous output at 6-10 Hz
 *          
 *          The driver maintains a line buffer to accumulate incoming characters and
 *          parses complete messages when a line terminator is received. Invalid or
 *          incomplete messages are discarded.
 *          
 *          Range Characteristics:
 *          - Minimum Range: ~15-20cm (objects closer return minimum reading)
 *          - Maximum Range: 500-600cm depending on model and target reflectivity
 *          - Beam Pattern: ~45-60 degree cone (varies by model)
 *          - Best Performance: Large, flat surfaces perpendicular to sensor
 *          
 *          Hardware Connection:
 *          - Connect sensor TX to autopilot RX on a configured serial port
 *          - Power from 3.3V or 5V depending on sensor model
 *          - No additional components required
 *          
 *          Configuration:
 *          - Set RNGFNDx_TYPE = 10 (MaxBotix Serial)
 *          - Configure serial port for 9600 baud (or sensor's configured rate)
 *          - Set RNGFNDx_MIN_CM and RNGFNDx_MAX_CM based on model
 *          - Typical max range: 500-600cm depending on MB1xxx model variant
 * 
 * @note This driver is optimized for the LV (Low Voltage) serial variants. For other
 *       MaxBotix product lines (analog, I2C, or high-voltage serial), use the appropriate
 *       driver class.
 * 
 * @warning Ultrasonic sensors have wide beam patterns and can be affected by:
 *          - Soft, sound-absorbing materials (foam, carpet, grass)
 *          - Surfaces at shallow angles (reflections away from sensor)
 *          - Acoustic interference from other ultrasonic sensors
 *          - Temperature and humidity variations
 *          
 *          Position sensors to minimize these effects for reliable operation.

     *

     *          - Validates numeric digits follow the 'R'
