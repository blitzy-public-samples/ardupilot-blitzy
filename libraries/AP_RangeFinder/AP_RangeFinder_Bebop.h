 * @file AP_RangeFinder_Bebop.h
 * @brief Parrot Bebop ultrasonic rangefinder backend driver
 * 
 * @details This driver implements support for the Parrot Bebop drone's built-in
 *          ultrasonic rangefinder sensor using Linux Industrial I/O (IIO) subsystem
 *          and SPI waveform capture.
 *          
 *          The Bebop rangefinder uses an ultrasonic transducer that transmits
 *          pulses and captures echo reflections via an ADC through the IIO interface.
 *          The driver performs real-time waveform analysis to detect echoes and
 *          calculate distance based on time-of-flight measurements.
 *          
 *          Key Features:
 *          - Dual-mode operation: switches between short-range and long-range modes
 *            based on altitude
 *          - Echo detection with local maxima search algorithm
 *          - Digital filtering and averaging to reduce noise
 *          - SPI-based waveform transmission and GPIO control
 *          - Runs in dedicated Linux thread for real-time operation
 *          
 *          Platform Requirements:
 *          - Linux HAL with IIO support
 *          - GPIO control capability
 *          - SPI device interface
 *          - Specific to Parrot Bebop hardware
 *          
 *          Hardware Interface:
 *          - Ultrasonic transducer controlled via GPIO
 *          - ADC capture via IIO device (/dev/iio:deviceX)
 *          - SPI for waveform generation
 *          
 * @note This driver is platform-specific to the Parrot Bebop drone and requires
 *       Linux HAL with IIO subsystem support. It will not work on other platforms.
 * 
 * @warning The ultrasonic sensor has limited accuracy at extreme ranges and may
 *          produce false readings in certain acoustic environments.
 * 
 * @see AP_RangeFinder_Backend
 * @see AP_HAL_Linux::Thread

 * @brief Rangefinder backend for Parrot Bebop ultrasonic sensor
 * 
 * @details This class implements a rangefinder driver for the Parrot Bebop drone's
 *          integrated ultrasonic altitude sensor. The driver uses Linux-specific
 *          interfaces (IIO subsystem, GPIO, SPI) to control the ultrasonic
 *          transducer and capture echo waveforms for time-of-flight distance
 *          measurement.
 *          
 *          Architecture:
 *          - Runs in a dedicated Linux thread for real-time waveform capture
 *          - Uses SPI to generate ultrasonic pulse waveforms
 *          - Captures echo waveforms via ADC through Linux IIO subsystem
 *          - Performs digital signal processing to detect echoes
 *          - Implements dual-mode operation (short/long range) with hysteresis
 *          
 *          Measurement Cycle:
 *          1. Configure GPIO to enable transducer
 *          2. Send pulse waveform via SPI
 *          3. Capture ADC waveform via IIO buffer
 *          4. Apply averaging filter to reduce noise
 *          5. Search for local maxima (echo peaks)
 *          6. Select best echo based on amplitude and position
 *          7. Calculate distance from time-of-flight
 *          8. Update rangefinder state
 *          
 *          Mode Switching:
 *          The driver automatically switches between two modes based on altitude:
 *          - Mode 0 (short-range): altitude > 0.75m, optimized for close objects
 *          - Mode 1 (long-range): altitude < 1.5m, extended range detection
 *          Hysteresis prevents oscillation between modes.
 *          
 * @note This driver is platform-specific to Parrot Bebop and requires:
 *       - Linux HAL with IIO subsystem support
 *       - libiio library for ADC access
 *       - GPIO control for transducer enable
 *       - SPI device for waveform generation
 *       
 * @warning Thread-safety: The _loop() method runs in a separate thread and
 *          accesses shared state variables. Proper synchronization is required.
