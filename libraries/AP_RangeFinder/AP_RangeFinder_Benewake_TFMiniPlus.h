 * @brief Driver for Benewake TFminiPlus 12-meter LiDAR rangefinder with I2C interface
 * 
 * @details This driver implements support for the Benewake TFminiPlus LiDAR distance sensor,
 *          an enhanced version of the original TFmini with improved performance characteristics.
 *          The TFminiPlus offers superior outdoor performance, extended range up to 12 meters,
 *          and better immunity to ambient light interference compared to the TFmini.
 * 
 *          Key Features:
 *          - Maximum range: 12 meters (vs 11 meters on TFmini)
 *          - Enhanced outdoor performance with better sunlight immunity
 *          - Improved accuracy and reliability
 *          - I2C communication interface
 *          - Configurable update rate
 *          - Built-in signal strength reporting
 * 
 *          The driver communicates via I2C protocol at the default address 0x10 and processes
 *          raw distance measurements with signal strength validation to ensure data quality.
 * 
 * @note This driver uses I2C interface. For serial/UART communication, use the TFmini serial driver.
 * 
 * @warning Ensure proper I2C bus configuration and address uniqueness to avoid conflicts.

 * @brief Benewake TFminiPlus 12-meter LiDAR rangefinder driver with I2C interface
 * 
 * @details This class implements the backend driver for the Benewake TFminiPlus LiDAR sensor,
 *          providing distance measurements up to 12 meters with enhanced outdoor performance.
 *          The TFminiPlus is an improved version of the TFmini with better ambient light rejection,
 *          extended range, and improved reliability in challenging environments.
 * 
 *          Protocol Details:
 *          - Communication: I2C interface at default address 0x10
 *          - Data format: Little-endian 16-bit distance and strength values
 *          - Update rate: Configurable, typically 100Hz
 *          - Data validation: Checksum verification on received packets
 *          - Signal strength: Reported with each measurement for quality assessment
 * 
 *          Performance Improvements over TFmini:
 *          - Extended maximum range: 12m vs 11m
 *          - Better outdoor performance with enhanced sunlight immunity
 *          - Improved accuracy and consistency
 *          - Lower susceptibility to ambient light interference
 *          - Enhanced reliability in varied environmental conditions
 * 
 *          Driver Operation:
 *          - Detection phase: Probes I2C bus for device presence
 *          - Initialization: Configures sensor and validates communication
 *          - Runtime: Periodic timer-based reading and accumulation of distance samples
 *          - Filtering: Accumulates multiple samples for noise reduction
 * 
 * @note Requires I2C bus with proper pullup resistors (typically 4.7kÎ©)
 * 
 * @warning Ensure I2C bus speed is compatible (typically 400kHz fast mode)
 * 
 * @see AP_RangeFinder_Backend for base class interface
 * @see AP_RangeFinder for rangefinder management
