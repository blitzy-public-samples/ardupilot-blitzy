/**
 * @file AP_RangeFinder_LightWareSerial.h
 * @brief LightWare Serial LiDAR rangefinder backend driver
 * 
 * This file implements the ArduPilot backend driver for LightWare LiDAR rangefinders
 * that communicate via serial protocol. LightWare produces high-performance laser
 * rangefinders with ranges exceeding 100 meters, suitable for terrain following,
 * obstacle avoidance, and precision landing applications.
 * 
 * Supported Models:
 * - SF20/C: Compact LiDAR with 100m range
 * - SF40C: Scanning LiDAR with 360Â° coverage and 100m range
 * - SF45B: Microlidar with 50m range and lightweight design
 * - Legacy LW20: Earlier generation serial LiDAR
 * 
 * Protocol Support:
 * The driver automatically detects and switches between two protocol modes:
 * - Legacy Protocol: ASCII string distances (e.g., "12.34\r\n")
 * - Binary Protocol: Two-byte binary distances for higher update rates
 * 
 * Scanning LiDAR Support:
 * For scanning models like SF40C, this driver retrieves the primary forward-facing
 * distance measurement. Multi-point scan data can be accessed through the
 * proximity sensor interface in AP_Proximity_LightWareSerial.
 * 
 * @note Binary protocol provides faster update rates and is preferred for
 *       real-time flight control applications
 * @warning Ensure correct serial port baud rate configuration (typically 115200 or 921600)

/**
 * @class AP_RangeFinder_LightWareSerial
 * @brief Backend driver for LightWare Serial LiDAR rangefinders
 * 
 * @details This class implements the serial communication protocol for LightWare
 *          laser rangefinders including SF20/C, SF40C, and SF45B models. The driver
 *          provides automatic protocol detection, switching between legacy ASCII
 *          string format and high-speed binary format depending on sensor configuration.
 *          
 *          Key Features:
 *          - Automatic protocol detection (legacy vs binary)
 *          - Signal quality reporting based on valid reading status
 *          - Lost signal detection for out-of-range conditions
 *          - Scanning LiDAR support (primary distance reading)
 *          - 100m+ range capability on supported models
 *          
 *          Initialization Sequence:
 *          1. Driver opens configured serial port
 *          2. Protocol state starts as UNKNOWN
 *          3. Incoming data analyzed to detect protocol type
 *          4. Once detected, driver locks to that protocol
 *          5. Distance readings processed according to protocol
 *          
 *          Thread Safety:
 *          This class is called from the scheduler thread during rangefinder updates.
 *          Serial communication is handled through the HAL UART driver which provides
 *          thread-safe buffering.
 *          
 * @note The LW20 model requires a brief initialization period to switch from
 *       I2C mode to serial mode on power-up
 * @warning Incorrect baud rate will prevent protocol detection and result in no readings

     *          
     *          Protocol Detection Algorithm:
     *          1. On startup, protocol_state is UNKNOWN
     *          2. Incoming bytes are tested against both protocol parsers
     *          3. Each successful parse increments that protocol's valid count

     *          Legacy Protocol Format:
     *          - ASCII string: "12.34\r\n" (distance in meters with CR+LF terminator)
     *          - Parsed into linebuf character array
     *          - Converted to float using string parsing
     *          
     *          Binary Protocol Format:
     *          - Two bytes: high byte followed by low byte
     *          - Distance in centimeters: distance_cm = (high_byte << 8) | low_byte

     *          Lost Signal Detection:

     *          These are checked via is_lost_signal_distance() and set no_signal flag.
