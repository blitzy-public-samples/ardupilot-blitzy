 * 
 * This file implements the driver for NoopLoop TOFSense time-of-flight (TOF) 
 * distance sensors that communicate via serial interface. The NoopLoop TOFSense
 * series are laser-based rangefinders that measure distance using time-of-flight
 * principles.
 * 
 * The driver handles serial communication protocol parsing, distance measurement
 * extraction, and integration with the ArduPilot rangefinder subsystem.

/**
 * @class AP_RangeFinder_NoopLoop
 * @brief NoopLoop TOFSense serial rangefinder backend implementation
 * 
 * @details This class implements support for NoopLoop TOFSense time-of-flight
 * rangefinders that communicate over a serial interface. The driver:
 * 
 * - Receives serial data from the NoopLoop TOFSense sensor
 * - Parses the proprietary NoopLoop protocol format
 * - Extracts distance measurements in meters
 * - Provides measurements to the rangefinder subsystem
 * - Reports sensor type as MAV_DISTANCE_SENSOR_LASER for telemetry
 * 
 * **Hardware Overview:**
 * NoopLoop TOFSense sensors are laser-based time-of-flight rangefinders that
 * measure distance by calculating the time for a laser pulse to reflect back
 * from a target. These sensors typically operate over UART serial connections.
 * 
 * **Serial Protocol:**
 * The sensor transmits distance data over serial using a line-based protocol.
 * Each measurement is received as a line of data that is parsed to extract
 * the distance reading.
 * 
 * **Lifecycle:**
 * 1. Sensor initialization via serial port configuration
 * 2. Continuous reception of serial data from sensor
 * 3. Line buffering and parsing of distance measurements
 * 4. Distance validation and state updates
 * 
 * **Thread Safety:**
 * This driver runs in the scheduler's rangefinder update task context.
 * Serial I/O operations are thread-safe through the HAL UART driver.
 * 
 * **Units:**
 * - Distance measurements: meters (m)
 * - Internal buffer: bytes
 * 
 * @note This sensor type is classified as a laser rangefinder for MAVLink reporting
 * @note Line buffering limits maximum line length to 16 bytes

     * 1. Reads available serial data into line buffer

     * The method uses linebuf[] to accumulate incoming serial bytes until a
     * complete measurement line is received. The buffer has a maximum capacity
     * of 16 bytes to prevent overflow.
