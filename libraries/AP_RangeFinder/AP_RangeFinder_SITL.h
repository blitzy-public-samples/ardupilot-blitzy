 * @brief SITL (Software-In-The-Loop) simulation backend for rangefinder sensors
 * 
 * @details This file implements a simulated rangefinder backend for ArduPilot's
 *          Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) testing environment. It provides realistic
 *          distance measurements by interfacing with SITL's physics simulation,
 *          enabling comprehensive testing of rangefinder-dependent features
 *          (terrain following, precision landing, obstacle avoidance) without
 *          requiring physical hardware.
 * 
 *          The SITL rangefinder backend simulates distance measurements using
 *          ray tracing techniques against the simulated environment, accounting
 *          for sensor orientation, vehicle attitude, and terrain geometry.

 * @class AP_RangeFinder_SITL
 * @brief Software-In-The-Loop simulation backend for rangefinder distance sensors
 * 
 * @details This class provides a simulated rangefinder implementation for SITL
 *          (Software-In-The-Loop) testing. It generates realistic distance
 *          measurements by performing ray tracing against the simulated environment,
 *          allowing comprehensive testing of rangefinder-dependent features without
 *          physical hardware.
 * 
 *          Key capabilities:
 *          - Simulates distance measurements using physics-based ray tracing
 *          - Accounts for sensor orientation and vehicle attitude
 *          - Supports terrain interaction and obstacle detection
 *          - Provides realistic sensor characteristics (noise, latency, limits)
 *          - Enables testing of terrain following, precision landing, and avoidance
 * 
 *          The SITL rangefinder interfaces with the SITL physics simulation to
 *          determine ground distance or obstacle range based on the sensor's
 *          configured orientation (downward-facing, forward-facing, etc.).
 * 
 *          Typical workflow:
 *          1. Constructor initializes sensor with instance-specific parameters
 *          2. update() is called periodically by the rangefinder driver
 *          3. Ray tracing is performed against simulated environment
 *          4. Distance measurement is stored in state structure
 *          5. MAVLink telemetry reports simulated distance to ground station
 * 
 * @note This backend is only available when AP_RANGEFINDER_SIM_ENABLED is defined
 * @note Used exclusively for simulation testing, not compiled for flight hardware
 * @note Supports multiple concurrent rangefinder instances (e.g., down + forward)
 * 
 * @see AP_RangeFinder_Backend
 * @see SITL::Aircraft for physics simulation interface

     * @brief Constructor for SITL rangefinder backend

     *          the instance number for identifying which simulated sensor to query from the
     *          SITL physics simulation.
     * 
     *          The constructor performs immediate initialization, preparing the sensor for
     *          distance measurement queries during subsequent update() calls. Multiple
     *          instances can be created to simulate multi-sensor configurations (e.g.,
     *          downward-facing for terrain following + forward-facing for obstacle avoidance).
     * 
     * @param[in,out] _state    Reference to rangefinder state structure for storing measurements.
     *                          Updated by update() with simulated distance, status, and timestamp.
     * @param[in]     _params   Reference to rangefinder parameter structure containing sensor
     *                          configuration (orientation, max range, offset, etc.)
     * @param[in]     instance  Sensor instance number (0-based). Used to identify which simulated
     *                          rangefinder to query from SITL physics simulation when multiple
     *                          sensors are configured. Typical values: 0=primary downward,
     *                          1=forward-facing, 2-9=additional sensors.
     * 
     * @note This constructor incorporates complete initialization - no separate init() required

     *          3. Check measurement validity against configured min/max range limits

     *          5. Handle out-of-range and no-target conditions appropriately
     *

     *          in the direction defined by the sensor's configured orientation, accounting

     *          and simulated obstacles to determine the measured distance.
     * 
     * @note Called at 10-20 Hz by rangefinder driver scheduler task
     * @note Distance measurements include simulated sensor noise and latency
