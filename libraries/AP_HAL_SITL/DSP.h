 * @brief Digital Signal Processing (DSP) implementation for SITL simulation
 * 
 * @details This file provides DSP functionality for Software-In-The-Loop (SITL)
 *          simulation, specifically implementing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
 *          analysis used for vibration detection and notch filter tuning.
 *          
 *          The SITL DSP implementation uses standard C++ complex number math
 *          to simulate the FFT processing that would occur on hardware platforms.
 *          This allows developers to test gyro FFT analysis and dynamic notch
 *          filtering in simulation before deploying to hardware.
 *          
 *          Key features:
 *          - Cooley-Tukey in-place FFT algorithm implementation
 *          - Hanning window application for frequency analysis
 *          - Integration with AP_GyroFFT for vibration analysis
 *          - Support for various FFT window sizes (typically 32-1024 samples)
 *          - Configurable sample rates and frequency resolution
 *          
 *          Typical use case: Analyzing gyroscope data to detect vibration
 *          frequencies and automatically tune notch filters to reduce noise
 *          in attitude control loops.
 * 
 * @note This implementation is for SITL simulation only. Hardware platforms
 *       (STM32, etc.) use optimized DSP libraries in AP_HAL_ChibiOS.
 * 
 * @warning Computational cost in SITL is not representative of real hardware.
 *          Real-time constraints may not apply in simulation environment.
 * 
 * @see AP_GyroFFT for gyroscope FFT analysis integration
 * @see AP_HAL::DSP for the abstract DSP interface
 * 
 * Requires HAL_WITH_DSP compile-time flag to be enabled.

 * @class HALSITL::DSP
 * @brief SITL implementation of Digital Signal Processing for FFT analysis
 * 
 * @details This class provides Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis capabilities
 *          for the Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulation environment. It implements
 *          the AP_HAL::DSP abstract interface using standard C++ complex number
 *          operations and the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm.
 *          
 *          The implementation simulates hardware DSP functionality that would
 *          normally be provided by optimized DSP libraries on ARM Cortex-M processors
 *          (such as CMSIS-DSP on STM32 platforms). This allows gyro FFT analysis
 *          and dynamic notch filter tuning to be tested in simulation.
 *          
 *          FFT Processing Pipeline:
 *          1. Initialize FFT state with window size and sample rate
 *          2. Apply Hanning window to input samples (reduces spectral leakage)
 *          3. Perform in-place Cooley-Tukey FFT
 *          4. Analyze frequency bins to find peak frequencies
 *          5. Output frequency and amplitude information
 *          
 *          Typical usage for vibration analysis:
 *          - Window sizes: 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 samples
 *          - Sample rates: Match gyro update rate (typically 1000-8000 Hz)
 *          - Frequency resolution: sample_rate / window_size Hz per bin
 *          - Analysis range: DC to Nyquist frequency (sample_rate / 2)
 * 
 * @note This is a simulation-only implementation. Computational overhead
 *       does not reflect real hardware performance characteristics.
 * 
 * @warning Real-time timing constraints in simulation may differ from hardware.
 *          Use for algorithm validation, not performance benchmarking.
 * 
 * @see AP_HAL::DSP for the abstract interface definition
 * @see AP_GyroFFT for the primary consumer of FFT analysis
