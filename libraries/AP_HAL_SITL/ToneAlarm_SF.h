 * @brief SFML-based tone alarm simulation for SITL (Software In The Loop)
 * 
 * @details This file implements a simulated tone alarm using the SFML audio library,
 *          providing audible feedback during SITL simulation. The tone alarm generates
 *          PCM audio output through SFML's audio system, allowing developers to test
 *          notify sequences, arming sounds, GPS fix indicators, and other audible
 *          alerts without requiring physical hardware.
 * 
 *          The implementation integrates with Synth.hpp for PCM audio generation,
 *          using ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelopes and oscillators
 *          to produce realistic buzzer tones. Tone sequences can be played from
 *          tune strings that encode frequency, duration, and pattern information.
 * 
 *          Audio Configuration:
 *          - Sample rate: Typically 44100 Hz
 *          - Buffer size: Optimized for low-latency playback
 *          - Output format: PCM stereo or mono depending on SFML configuration
 * 
 *          Tone Alarm Patterns:
 *          - Arming sequence: Ascending tones indicating vehicle is ready to arm
 *          - GPS fix acquired: Confirmation beeps when GPS achieves 3D fix
 *          - Battery warnings: Distinctive patterns for low battery conditions
 *          - Failsafe activation: Urgent tone patterns for failsafe triggers
 *          - Mode changes: Audio confirmation of flight mode transitions
 *          - Pre-arm check failures: Specific patterns for different failure types
 * 
 * @note This feature requires the SFML audio library (libsfml-audio) to be installed
 *       and is guarded by the WITH_SITL_TONEALARM compile-time flag. If SFML is not
 *       available, tone alarm functionality will be disabled in SITL builds.
 * 
 * @warning Audio output may be loud depending on system volume settings. Users should
 *          ensure appropriate audio levels before running SITL simulations with tone
 *          alarm enabled. The tone alarm provides valuable feedback but can be
 *          startling at high volumes.

     * @class ToneAlarm_SF
     * @brief SFML-based tone alarm simulator for audible feedback in SITL
     * 
     * @details This class provides a software implementation of the tone alarm/piezo buzzer
     *          found on physical autopilot hardware, using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia
     *          Library) for audio output. It enables developers to test and debug notify
     *          sequences during simulation without requiring actual hardware.
     * 
     *          The tone alarm is a critical component of ArduPilot's notification system,
     *          providing audible feedback for important events and system states. This
     *          SITL implementation faithfully reproduces the timing and frequency patterns
     *          of hardware buzzers, allowing realistic testing of:
     * 
     *          - Arming and disarming procedures
     *          - GPS fix acquisition and loss
     *          - Battery voltage warnings
     *          - Failsafe activations (RC loss, GPS loss, battery failsafe)
     *          - EKF errors and pre-arm check failures
     *          - User-defined notification sequences
     * 
     *          Integration with Audio Synthesis:
     *          The class integrates with Synth.hpp to generate PCM audio samples using
     *          oscillators and ADSR envelopes. Each tone is rendered as a sequence of
     *          audio samples that are buffered and played through SFML's audio system.
     * 
     *          Tone Sequence Playback:
     *          Tone sequences are typically encoded as tune strings (e.g., "MFT240L8O4aO5c")
     *          that specify tempo, octave, note duration, and frequency. The class decodes
     *          these strings and plays the corresponding tones in sequence, maintaining
     *          accurate timing to reproduce hardware behavior.
     * 
     *          Use Case:
     *          This simulator is particularly valuable for:
     *          - Testing notify sequences without hardware
     *          - Debugging timing-sensitive audio patterns
     *          - Verifying arming check audio feedback
     *          - Educational demonstrations of ArduPilot's notification system
     *          - CI/CD automated testing with audio verification (if recording enabled)
     * 
     * @note Requires SFML audio library and WITH_SITL_TONEALARM build flag
     * @warning Audio output depends on host system audio configuration and may not work
     *          in headless environments without audio hardware or virtual audio devices
     * 
     * @see AP_Notify::ToneAlarm for the abstract interface this implements
     * @see libraries/AP_HAL_SITL/Synth.hpp for audio synthesis implementation

         * @brief Set buzzer tone frequency, volume, and duration
         * 
         * @details This method configures and initiates playback of a single tone through
         *          the SFML audio system. The tone is generated using an oscillator with
         *          the specified frequency and shaped using an ADSR envelope to create a
         *          realistic buzzer sound. The audio synthesis chain creates PCM samples
         *          that are buffered and played through SFML's audio output.
         * 
         *          The method handles:
         *          - Oscillator frequency configuration (typically 500 Hz - 4000 Hz range)
         *          - Volume scaling and normalization
         *          - Duration timing and envelope shaping
         *          - Audio buffer management
         *          - Seamless transitions between consecutive tones
         * 
         *          ADSR Envelope Application:
         *          - Attack: Quick rise time (1-5 ms) to avoid clicks
         *          - Decay: Brief decay to sustain level
         *          - Sustain: Held for the majority of tone duration
         *          - Release: Smooth fade-out to avoid clicks at tone end
         * 
         *          This method is typically called repeatedly with different parameters
         *          to create tone sequences for various notification patterns (arming,

         * @param[in] frequency   Tone frequency in Hz (typically 100 Hz - 8000 Hz range,
         *                        common values: 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 1500 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz)
         * @param[in] volume      Tone volume (0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 is maximum output level,
         *                        typically 0.5 for comfortable listening during development)
         * @param[in] duration_ms Tone duration in milliseconds (typically 50 ms - 2000 ms,
         *                        shorter durations for beeps, longer for sustained tones)
         * 
         * @note Called at various rates depending on tone sequence requirements, typically
         *       not called faster than every 10 ms to allow proper tone separation
         * @note Volume is scaled by the audio synthesis engine and may be affected by
         *       system volume settings and audio device configuration
         * @warning Very high frequencies (>8000 Hz) or very long durations (>5000 ms) may
         *          cause audio artifacts or buffer overruns. Use reasonable values based
         *          on typical hardware buzzer capabilities.

         * @details This method initializes the SFML audio subsystem and prepares the
         *          tone alarm for playback. Initialization includes:
         * 
         *          - Loading and initializing SFML audio library
         *          - Configuring audio output device (sample rate, buffer size, channels)
         *          - Allocating audio buffers for PCM sample generation
         *          - Initializing the audio synthesis engine (oscillators, envelopes)
         *          - Setting up timing and scheduling for tone sequences
         *          - Testing audio device availability and capability
         * 
         *          Audio Device Configuration:

         *          - Channels: Mono or stereo depending on synthesis configuration
         *          - Buffer size: Optimized for low-latency playback (typically 512-2048 samples)
         * 
         *          The initialization process verifies that:
         *          - SFML audio library is available and functional
         *          - System audio device can be opened for playback
         *          - Audio format is supported by the output device

         *          the method returns false and tone alarm features are disabled.
         * 
         *          Use Case:

         *               audio device could not be opened, or WITH_SITL_TONEALARM not defined)
         * 
         * @note Must be called before set_buzzer_tone() can be used
