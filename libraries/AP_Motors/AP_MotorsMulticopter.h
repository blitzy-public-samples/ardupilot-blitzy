 * @class AP_MotorsMulticopter
 * @brief Base class for all multicopter motor mixing implementations
 * 
 * @details AP_MotorsMulticopter provides the foundation for all multirotor motor control in ArduPilot.
 *          Derived classes (AP_MotorsMatrix, AP_MotorsSingle, AP_MotorsCoax, AP_MotorsTri, etc.)
 *          implement frame-specific motor mixing while this base class handles common multicopter features.
 * 
 * ## Spool State Machine
 * 
 * The spool state machine ensures safe motor transitions during arming, takeoff, and landing:
 * 
 * - **SHUT_DOWN**: Motors stopped, outputs at minimum PWM. Vehicle is disarmed or emergency stopped.
 * - **GROUND_IDLE**: Motors spinning at MOT_SPIN_ARM speed (default 10% throttle range). 
 *                    Vehicle is armed on ground, preparing for takeoff. Provides stable control for pre-flight checks.
 * - **SPOOLING_UP**: Ramping from ground idle to flight speed over MOT_SPOOL_TIME (default 0.5s).
 *                    Gradual acceleration protects ESCs and mechanical components from sudden loads.
 * - **THROTTLE_UNLIMITED**: Normal flight state with full throttle authority from MOT_SPIN_MIN to MOT_SPIN_MAX.
 *                           All control loops operate normally with complete thrust range.
 * - **SPOOLING_DOWN**: Ramping down from flight speed to ground idle during landing.
 *                      Gradual deceleration provides smooth touchdown and protects mechanics.
 * 
 * Transitions between states are managed automatically based on pilot input, altitude, and flight mode.
 * 
 * ## Thrust Linearization
 * 
 * ESCs, motors, and propellers have a non-linear thrust response to PWM input. The thrust linearization
 * system (via Thrust_Linearization member thr_lin) compensates for this to provide linear control:
 * 
 * - thrust_to_actuator(): Converts desired thrust (0-1) to ESC actuator output using curve_expo
 * - actuator_to_thrust(): Inverse function for control loops to compute required actuator values
 * - MOT_THST_EXPO parameter: Controls linearization curve (0=linear, 0.65=default quadratic approximation, 1=full quadratic)
 * 
 * Proper thrust linearization is critical for:
 * - Predictable attitude control across throttle range
 * - Consistent auto-tune results
 * - Stable hover in varying flight conditions
 * 
 * ## Battery Compensation
 * 
 * Battery voltage sag and current limiting affect available thrust. Compensation systems include:
 * 
 * - **Voltage Compensation**: Adjusts _throttle_thrust_max based on battery voltage relative to MOT_BAT_VOLT_MAX.
 *                             As voltage drops, maximum available thrust is reduced proportionally to maintain
 *                             consistent control authority. Prevents over-demanding ESCs at low voltage.
 * 
 * - **Current Limiting**: If battery current exceeds MOT_BAT_CURR_MAX, thrust is limited to stay below the limit.
 *                         Prevents battery damage and voltage collapse. Uses MOT_BAT_CURR_TC time constant for filtering.
 * 
 * - **Lift Max Scaling**: The lift_max value (inherited from AP_Motors) represents maximum available thrust after
 *                         applying voltage and current compensation. Control loops use this to scale demands.
 * 
 * ## Motor Spin Limits
 * 
 * Motor spin parameters define the usable throttle range for stable control:
 * 
 * - **MOT_SPIN_MIN** (default 0.15): Minimum motor speed for reliable attitude control. Below this speed,
 *                                     motors may not respond predictably to small thrust changes.
 * - **MOT_SPIN_MAX** (default 0.95): Maximum motor speed, leaving headroom for control mixing and yaw authority.
 * - **MOT_SPIN_ARM** (default 0.10): Armed ground idle speed. High enough to verify motor rotation, low enough for safety.
 * 
 * Values are ratios (0-1) of the full throttle range from MOT_PWM_MIN to MOT_PWM_MAX.
 * 
 * ## Yaw Headroom
 * 
 * MOT_YAW_HEADROOM (default 200Âµs) reserves PWM range exclusively for yaw control. When motors are near
 * maximum thrust, this headroom ensures yaw commands can still be executed by reducing collective thrust
 * and increasing differential thrust. Critical for maintaining yaw authority during aggressive climbs.
 * 
 * ## Throttle Hover Learning
 * 
 * The system learns hover throttle (MOT_THST_HOVER) during flight when in altitude-holding modes:
 * - Learns from actual thrust required to maintain altitude
 * - Filtered with MOT_THST_HOVER_TC time constant (10 seconds default)
 * - Used by position controller for feedforward thrust estimation
 * - Can be saved to parameters on disarm with MOT_HOVER_LEARN=2
 * 
 * @note This is an abstract base class. Derived classes must implement output_to_motors() for frame-specific mixing.
 * @note All thrust values in the API use 0-1 range. PWM values are in microseconds.
 * @note Coordinate system: Body frame with X forward, Y right, Z down (NED convention).
 * 
 * @warning Incorrect MOT_SPIN_MIN/MAX values can cause loss of control or ESC damage.
 * @warning MOT_THST_EXPO must be tuned for your specific motor/ESC/propeller combination.
 * @warning Battery compensation parameters are critical for safe operation - do not disable without testing.
