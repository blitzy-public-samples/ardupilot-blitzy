/**
 * @file AP_MotorsMatrix.h
 * @brief Motor control class for matrix-based multicopter motor mixing
 * 
 * @details This file implements matrix-style motor mixing for standard multicopter frames.
 *          The AP_MotorsMatrix class converts roll, pitch, yaw, and throttle (RPYT) commands
 *          into individual motor thrust values using a geometric mixing matrix. This approach
 *          supports standard frame configurations (quad, hexa, octa) as well as custom
 *          motor arrangements with up to 32 motors.
 *          
 *          The mixing algorithm computes motor thrust using:
 *          thrust[i] = throttle + roll*roll_factor[i] + pitch*pitch_factor[i] + yaw*yaw_factor[i]
 *          
 *          Motor factors are derived from geometric position and rotation direction.
 *          The class handles motor failure detection and compensation, test sequencing,
 *          and various frame-specific motor arrangements.

 * @class AP_MotorsMatrix
 * @brief Matrix-style motor mixing for standard multicopter frames
 * 
 * @details This class implements motor control for multicopters using a mixing matrix approach.
 *          It converts pilot input (roll, pitch, yaw, throttle) into individual motor thrust
 *          commands through geometric mixing factors.
 *          
 *          **Purpose**: Provides flexible motor mixing for standard and custom multicopter configurations
 *          
 *          **Mixing Algorithm**: 
 *          For each motor i, the output thrust is calculated as:
 *          ```
 *          thrust[i] = throttle + roll*roll_factor[i] + pitch*pitch_factor[i] + yaw*yaw_factor[i]
 *          ```
 *          
 *          **Factor Calculation from Geometry**:
 *          - roll_factor[i] = sin(motor_angle[i]) - describes motor's roll authority
 *          - pitch_factor[i] = cos(motor_angle[i]) - describes motor's pitch authority  
 *          - yaw_factor[i] = Â±1 where -1=CW rotation (negative torque), +1=CCW (positive torque)
 *          - throttle_factor[i] = typically 1.0, can vary for thrust vectoring
 *          
 *          **Normalization**: All RPY factors are normalized so maximum magnitude = 0.5
 *          to prevent saturation and ensure control authority remains balanced.
 *          
 *          **Frame Support**: 
 *          - Quad: Plus (+), X, V, H configurations
 *          - Hexa: Plus, X, DJI, IIR configurations  
 *          - Octa: Plus, X, V, DJI, IIR, Wide configurations
 *          - Y6: Coaxial tri-rotor configuration
 *          - Deca, OctaQuad, DodecaHexa: High motor count configurations
 *          - Custom: User-defined motor arrangements via scripting
 *          
 *          **Motor Numbering**:
 *          - Internal: 0-based indexing (AP_MOTORS_MOT_1 = 0)
 *          - User parameters: 1-based (MOT_1 in parameters = motor 0 internally)
 *          - Maximum: 32 motors (AP_MOTORS_MAX_NUM_MOTORS)
 *          
 *          **Motor Ordering**: Configurable test sequence determines motor test order,
 *          typically 1,2,3,4... proceeding around the frame. Supports standard ArduPilot
 *          numbering as well as Betaflight and DJI conventions.
 *          
 *          **Motor Failure Handling**: Detects failed motors through thrust monitoring
 *          and can compensate by increasing thrust on remaining motors via thrust boost.
 * 
 * @note Motor factors are stored in arrays: _roll_factor[], _pitch_factor[], _yaw_factor[],
 *       _throttle_factor[], with outputs in _thrust_rpyt_out[]
 * 
 * @note Testing order array (_test_order[]) determines sequence for motor test mode
 * 
 * @warning Motor test mode WILL SPIN MOTORS - always remove propellers before testing
 * 
 * @warning Incorrect motor angles cause wrong control response (e.g., roll commands produce pitch)
 * 
 * @warning Wrong yaw factors (CW/CCW reversed) cause yaw instability and oscillation
