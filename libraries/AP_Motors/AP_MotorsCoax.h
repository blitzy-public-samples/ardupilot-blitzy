 * @brief Motor and Servo control class for coaxial counter-rotating helicopters
 * 
 * @details This file implements motor control for coaxial helicopter configurations
 *          featuring two counter-rotating rotors mounted on the same axis (one above
 *          the other) plus four control surfaces (flaps or elevons) for cyclic control.
 *          
 *          Configuration:
 *          - Upper rotor: Rotates counter-clockwise (CCW) when viewed from above
 *          - Lower rotor: Rotates clockwise (CW) when viewed from above
 *          - Control surfaces: 4 servos providing roll/pitch control via differential deflection
 *          
 *          The coaxial design eliminates the need for a tail rotor since the counter-rotating
 *          rotors cancel out torque. Yaw control is achieved through differential collective
 *          (speed difference between upper and lower rotors). Roll and pitch are controlled
 *          via the four control surfaces arranged around the rotor mast.
 *          
 *          This is a mechanically simpler and more compact design compared to conventional
 *          single-rotor helicopters, with improved yaw authority and reduced mechanical
 *          complexity.
 * 
 * @note Motor rotation direction is critical - reversed motor directions will cause
 *       immediate loss of control and potential vehicle damage.
 * 
 * @warning Both motors must spool up synchronously. Loss of one motor causes severe
 *          yaw instability and requires immediate emergency landing.

 * @class AP_MotorsCoax
 * @brief Motor control implementation for coaxial counter-rotating helicopter with four control surfaces
 * 
 * @details This class provides motor mixing and control for coaxial helicopter configurations.
 *          The vehicle uses two counter-rotating rotors mounted coaxially (on the same vertical
 *          axis) plus four servo-driven control surfaces for cyclic pitch/roll control.
 *          
 *          Physical Configuration:
 *          - Motor 1 (Upper): Counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation when viewed from above
 *          - Motor 2 (Lower): Clockwise (CW) rotation when viewed from above  
 *          - Servos 1-4: Control surfaces positioned around the rotor mast
 *          
 *          Control Strategy:
 *          - Collective (altitude): Both motors increase/decrease thrust together
 *          - Yaw: Differential thrust between upper and lower rotors
 *                 (increasing upper rotor speed relative to lower creates CCW yaw)
 *          - Roll/Pitch: Four control surfaces deflect differentially to create cyclic effect
 *                        Control surface deflection range: Â±4500 centidegrees
 *          
 *          Torque Cancellation:
 *          Counter-rotating rotors naturally cancel torque reactions, eliminating the need
 *          for a tail rotor. This provides several advantages:
 *          - Mechanical simplicity (no tail rotor drive system)
 *          - Improved yaw authority at all airspeeds
 *          - More compact airframe design
 *          - Better hover efficiency (no power lost to tail rotor)
 *          
 *          The mixing algorithm distributes pilot inputs across the six actuators
 *          (2 motors + 4 servos) to achieve desired vehicle motion while maintaining
 *          rotor synchronization and control surface coordination.
 * 
 * @note NUM_ACTUATORS is set to 4 for the control surfaces. Motors are handled separately
 *       through the inherited multicopter motor management system.
 * 
 * @note Upper rotor must rotate CCW and lower rotor CW (viewed from above). Reversed
 *       motor directions will cause immediate instability as the torque cancellation
 *       becomes torque addition.
 * 
 * @warning Motor direction is safety-critical. Verify motor rotation direction during
 *          initial setup before attempting flight. Incorrect rotation will cause immediate
 *          loss of control and likely vehicle destruction.
 * 
 * @warning Control surface binding or mechanical failure can cause loss of cyclic control.
 *          Always verify full, free servo movement before flight.
 * 
 * @warning Both motors must spool up synchronously. Unequal spool rates will cause yaw
 *          instability during takeoff. Loss of one motor in flight causes severe yaw
 *          instability requiring immediate controlled descent.
