 * @file AP_GPS_NMEA.h
 * @brief NMEA 0183 ASCII protocol parser for GPS receivers
 * 
 * @details This is a lightweight NMEA parser implementing the NMEA 0183 standard,
 *          derived originally from the TinyGPS parser by Mikal Hart. It is frugal
 *          in its use of memory and tries to avoid unnecessary arithmetic.
 *          
 *          The parser handles standard NMEA sentences:
 *          - GPGGA: Global Positioning System Fix Data (position, altitude, fix quality, satellites, HDOP)
 *          - GPRMC: Recommended Minimum Specific GPS/Transit Data (position, velocity, course, date)
 *          - GPVTG: Track Made Good and Ground Speed (velocity over ground, course)
 *          
 *          Additionally supports vendor-specific extensions:
 *          - KSXT: Unicore 3D velocity and yaw
 *          - AGRICA: Unicore RTK position and heading
 *          - PHD: AllyStar vertical velocity and accuracy (maps ublox UBX to NMEA)
 *          - THS: Trimble true heading with quality indicator
 *          - VERSIONA: Unicore firmware version
 *          - UNIHEADINGA: Unicore dual-antenna heading
 *          
 *          The parser attempts to be robust in the face of occasional corruption
 *          in the input stream. It makes a basic effort to configure GPS receivers
 *          that are likely to be connected in NMEA mode (SiRF, MediaTek, ublox)
 *          to emit the correct message stream, but does not validate that the
 *          correct stream is being received.
 *          
 *          Coordinate Systems:
 *          - Position: WGS84 geodetic coordinates (latitude/longitude in degrees,
 *            altitude above mean sea level in meters)
 *          - Velocity: Ground speed in m/s, course over ground in degrees
 *          - Frame: Earth-fixed frame (latitude positive north, longitude positive east)
 *          
 *          Unit Conventions:
 *          - Input (NMEA format): Degrees/minutes (DDMM.MMMM), knots, feet
 *          - Internal representation: Decimal degrees Ã— 1e7, meters, m/s
 *          - Output: SI units (degrees, meters, m/s)
 * 
 * @note NMEA 0183 is widely supported across GPS receivers but is less efficient
 *       than binary protocols due to ASCII encoding and lower update rates (typically 1-10 Hz).
 *       Binary protocols (ublox UBX, DroneCAN) are preferred for high-performance applications.
 * 
 * @warning A GPS unit emitting only GPRMC sentences will show as having a fix
 *          even though no altitude data is being received. This can lead to
 *          incorrect altitude estimates derived solely from barometric pressure.
 * 
 * @warning GPVTG data is parsed, but as the message may not contain the qualifier
 *          field (common with older SiRF units), it is not considered a reliable
 *          source of fix-valid information.
 *

/**
 * @class AP_GPS_NMEA
 * @brief NMEA 0183 protocol parser backend for ArduPilot GPS driver
 * 
 * @details This class implements a robust parser for NMEA 0183 ASCII GPS protocol.
 *          It processes character-by-character input from the GPS receiver, validates
 *          checksums, and extracts position, velocity, time, and fix quality data.
 *          
 *          Parser State Machine:
 *          1. Searches for sentence start ($GP, $GN, $GL, $BD or # for Unicore)
 *          2. Accumulates characters and calculates checksum parity
 *          3. Splits sentence into comma-separated terms
 *          4. Processes terms based on sentence type
 *          5. Validates checksum before accepting data
 *          
 *          Sentence Processing:
 *          - GPGGA: Extracts time, lat/lon, altitude, fix quality, satellite count, HDOP
 *          - GPRMC: Extracts time, date, lat/lon, speed, course, magnetic variation
 *          - GPVTG: Extracts course and speed over ground
 *          - Vendor extensions: Extract heading, 3D velocity, accuracy estimates
 *          
 *          Auto-Configuration:
 *          Attempts to configure known GPS receivers to output appropriate NMEA sentences:
 *          - SiRF: Sends SiRF binary protocol switch to NMEA mode
 *          - MediaTek: Configures output message types and rate
 *          - ublox: Configures NMEA talker ID and message selection
 *          
 *          Thread Safety:
 *          - Called from GPS detection thread or GPS driver thread
 *          - Inherits thread safety from AP_GPS_Backend base class
 *          - Internal state protected by GPS state machine
 *          
 *          Performance:
 *          - Character-by-character parsing minimizes memory usage
 *          - No buffering of complete sentences
 *          - Temporary storage only for parsed numeric values
 *          - Typical execution: <100 microseconds per character on ARM Cortex-M
 * 
 * @note Most modern GPS receivers support both NMEA and binary protocols.
 *       Binary protocols are strongly preferred for autopilot use due to higher
 *       update rates, better accuracy representation, and lower CPU overhead.
 * 
 * @warning This parser does not validate that GPS is configured optimally.
 *          It will accept whatever NMEA sentences are received, which may be
 *          insufficient for autopilot operation (e.g., missing altitude data).

     *          This method is called repeatedly by the GPS driver task (typically at 10-50 Hz)

     *          3. When complete sentence detected, _term_complete() extracts data

     *         and GPS state has been updated with new data
     * @return false if no complete sentence available yet, sentence invalid, or checksum failed
     * 
     * @note This method is non-blocking and processes only available characters.
     *       Multiple calls may be required to complete a single sentence.
     * 
     * @note Typical NMEA update rates: 1 Hz (basic receivers) to 10 Hz (modern receivers).

     * @brief Send GPS receiver type-specific configuration strings
     * 
     * @details Attempts to auto-configure known GPS receivers to output appropriate
     *          NMEA sentences for autopilot use. Sends initialization strings to:
     *          
     *          SiRF Receivers:
     *          - Switch from SiRF binary protocol to NMEA mode
     *          - Configure output message types (GGA, RMC, VTG)
     *          - Set update rate to maximum
     *          
     *          MediaTek Receivers:
     *          - Configure NMEA sentence selection
     *          - Set update rate (typically 5 Hz or 10 Hz)
     *          - Enable WAAS/EGNOS if available
     *          
     *          ublox Receivers:
     *          - Configure UBX-CFG-NMEA for optimal settings
     *          - Set talker ID to GP or GN
     *          - Enable high-precision mode if supported
     *          
     *          Unicore Receivers:
     *          - Configure serial port baud rate (230400)
     *          - Enable GPGGA output at 5 Hz
     *          - Prepare for proprietary sentence reception
     *          
     *          Configuration is sent periodically (every few seconds) until GPS
     *          starts producing valid output, as receiver type is not known until
     *          after detection completes.
     * 
     * @note Configuration strings are GPS type-specific and may not work on all receivers
     * @note Some receivers ignore configuration if already in NMEA mode
     * @note Called periodically from read() until GPS provides valid fix data
     * 
     * @see _initialisation_blob, _SiRF_init_string, _ublox_init_string for config data
