/**
 * @file AP_Mount_Servo.h
 * @brief Servo-based mount control backend for camera gimbals
 * 
 * @details This backend provides control for servo or PWM-based camera gimbals.
 *          Supports two operational modes:
 *          1. Servo mode with stabilization: Requires earth-frame to body-frame
 *             coordinate transformations to stabilize camera pointing against
 *             vehicle attitude changes. Uses lead compensation for improved tracking.
 *          2. BrushlessPWM mode: Self-stabilizing gimbals that handle their own
 *             stabilization internally, requiring only angle commands.
 * 
 *          The backend integrates with ArduPilot's SRV_Channel system to output
 *          PWM signals to servo motors controlling roll, tilt (pitch), and pan (yaw) axes.
 * 
 * @note Angle units: Targets are in earth-frame radians, servo outputs are in
 *       body-frame degrees*10. Update rate minimum: 10Hz.

 * @class AP_Mount_Servo
 * @brief Backend class for controlling servo/PWM-based camera gimbals
 * 
 * @details Implements mount control using standard PWM servo outputs. This backend
 *          supports two distinct gimbal types based on their stabilization capabilities:
 * 
 *          **Servo Gimbals (requires_stabilization = true)**:
 *          - Simple servos that directly follow commanded angles
 *          - Requires earth-frame to body-frame transformation by backend
 *          - Uses vehicle AHRS attitude to compute stabilized body-frame commands
 *          - Implements lead compensation (MNT_ROLL_STB_LEAD, MNT_PITCH_STB_LEAD)
 *            to compensate for vehicle rotation during attitude updates
 *          - Suitable for basic pan-tilt mechanisms without onboard stabilization
 * 
 *          **BrushlessPWM Gimbals (requires_stabilization = false)**:
 *          - Gimbals with integrated controllers that self-stabilize
 *          - Backend passes through earth-frame angles without transformation
 *          - Gimbal controller handles all stabilization internally
 *          - Suitable for brushless gimbal controllers with IMU integration
 * 
 *          The backend manages servo channels for up to four axes:
 *          - Roll: Camera roll axis rotation
 *          - Tilt (Pitch): Camera elevation angle
 *          - Pan (Yaw): Camera azimuth angle
 *          - Open: Shutter or mechanism activation
 * 
 *          **Frame Convention**:
 *          - Earth frame: NED (North-East-Down) coordinate system
 *          - Body frame: Vehicle-relative coordinates (forward-right-down)
 *          - Servo outputs: Body-frame angles in degrees*10 format
 * 
 *          **Update Rate**: Minimum 10Hz for smooth gimbal control and lead compensation
 * 
 * @note Thread Safety: Called from main thread only, no special locking required
 * @warning Incorrect stabilization mode can cause unstable gimbal behavior
 * 
 * @see AP_Mount_Backend for base class interface
 * @see SRV_Channel for servo output management
