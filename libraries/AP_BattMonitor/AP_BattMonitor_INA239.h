/**
 * @class AP_BattMonitor_INA239
 * @brief Battery monitor backend for Texas Instruments INA239 I2C/SPI power monitor chip
 * 
 * @details This backend interfaces with the Texas Instruments INA239 precision power monitor
 *          for high-accuracy battery voltage and current measurement via SPI bus. The INA239
 *          provides 16-bit ADC resolution for both voltage and current sensing with programmable
 *          conversion times and averaging. This implementation uses timer-based accumulation
 *          to collect samples at high frequency (~100Hz) and provides averaged readings at
 *          the standard battery monitor update rate (~10Hz).
 * 
 *          Key Features:
 *          - Bidirectional current measurement (charge and discharge)
 *          - High-precision voltage measurement (up to 85V bus voltage)
 *          - Programmable shunt resistor calibration
 *          - SPI interface for low-latency communication
 *          - Hardware accumulation with semaphore protection for thread safety
 * 
 * @note Requires calibration using shunt resistor value (rShunt) and maximum expected
 *       current (max_amps) parameters for accurate current measurement
 * @warning Ensure shunt resistor power rating exceeds maximum expected power dissipation
 *          (IÂ²R) to prevent overheating and measurement drift
 * 
 * @see AP_BattMonitor_Backend
 * @see Texas Instruments INA239 datasheet for register definitions and electrical specifications
