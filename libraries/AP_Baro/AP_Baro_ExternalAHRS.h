/**
 * @file AP_Baro_ExternalAHRS.h
 * @brief Barometer driver for external AHRS systems
 * 
 * @details This file implements a barometer backend that receives barometric
 *          pressure and temperature data from external Attitude and Heading
 *          Reference Systems (AHRS). This allows ArduPilot to use barometer
 *          data from integrated navigation systems such as VectorNav, LORD
 *          Microstrain, and other external AHRS units that provide barometric
 *          altitude information alongside attitude data.
 *          
 *          The driver accumulates multiple readings and provides averaged
 *          measurements to the main barometer library for improved accuracy
 *          and noise reduction.
 * 
 * @note This backend is only used when an external AHRS system is configured
 *       and that system provides integrated barometer readings.

/**
 * @class AP_Baro_ExternalAHRS
 * @brief Barometer backend for external AHRS systems that provide barometric data
 * 
 * @details This class integrates barometer data from external AHRS systems into
 *          ArduPilot's barometer subsystem. External AHRS devices like VectorNav
 *          VN-100/200/300, LORD Microstrain 3DM-GX5/GQ7, and similar navigation
 *          systems often include integrated barometric pressure sensors alongside
 *          their IMU and magnetometer sensors.
 *          
 *          Rather than requiring a separate barometer sensor, this backend allows
 *          ArduPilot to use the barometer data provided by the external AHRS unit
 *          through the ExternalAHRS protocol. This reduces sensor redundancy and
 *          can improve data synchronization between attitude and altitude measurements.
 *          
 *          The implementation accumulates multiple barometer readings received from
 *          the external system and averages them during each update() cycle to
 *          reduce noise and provide smooth altitude estimates.
 * 
 * @note Only active when AP_BARO_EXTERNALAHRS_ENABLED is set and an external
 *       AHRS device is configured with barometer support enabled.
 * 
 * @see AP_ExternalAHRS for the external AHRS interface protocol
 * @see AP_Baro_Backend for the base barometer backend interface
