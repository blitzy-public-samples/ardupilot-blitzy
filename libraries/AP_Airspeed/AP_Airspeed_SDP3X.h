 * @brief Sensirion SDP3x I2C differential pressure sensor backend driver
 * 
 * @details This driver supports the Sensirion SDP3x sensor family (SDP31, SDP32, SDP33)
 *          for differential pressure measurement used in airspeed calculation. The SDP3x
 *          sensors communicate via I2C and provide continuous measurement with built-in
 *          averaging to reduce noise.
 *          
 *          Key features:
 *          - Continuous measurement mode with ~50Hz sampling and averaging
 *          - Sensirion CRC8 validation for data integrity (polynomial 0x31)
 *          - Automatic scale detection based on sensor product ID
 *          - Air density compensation using barometer data for altitude correction
 *          - Temperature compensation for accurate pressure readings
 *          
 *          The driver implements the Sensirion I2C protocol with CRC validation
 *          to ensure data integrity, which is critical for safety in flight control.
 *

/**
 * @class AP_Airspeed_SDP3X
 * @brief Backend driver for Sensirion SDP3x differential pressure sensors
 * 
 * @details This class implements the AP_Airspeed_Backend interface for Sensirion
 *          SDP3x series differential pressure sensors (SDP31, SDP32, SDP33). These
 *          sensors measure the pressure difference between pitot and static ports,
 *          which is used to calculate airspeed.
 *          
 *          **Measurement Mode:**
 *          The driver configures the sensor in continuous measurement mode with
 *          averaging, providing stable readings at approximately 50Hz. Samples are
 *          accumulated and averaged to reduce noise before being made available to
 *          the airspeed library.
 *          
 *          **Data Integrity:**
 *          All sensor communications use Sensirion's CRC8 checksum (polynomial 0x31,
 *          initial value 0xFF) to validate data integrity. Invalid CRC results in
 *          sample rejection, ensuring corrupted data never reaches flight control.
 *          
 *          **Scale Detection:**
 *          The driver automatically detects the sensor's pressure scale factor from
 *          the product ID during initialization. Different SDP3x variants have
 *          different pressure ranges and corresponding scale factors.
 *          
 *          **Air Density Compensation:**
 *          Raw pressure readings are compensated for air density using barometer
 *          data. This rho_air correction is essential for accurate airspeed
 *          calculation at varying altitudes, as air density decreases with altitude.
 *          
 *          **Thread Safety:**
 *          Sensor reading occurs in HAL timer callback context. Data is accumulated
 *          with simple counters (no mutex required as access is from single thread).
 *          
 * @note This driver requires an I2C bus and assumes sensor is at standard SDP3x address
 * @warning CRC validation failure indicates corrupted data - reading is discarded for safety
 * @warning Air density compensation is required for accurate airspeed at altitude
 * 
 * @see AP_Airspeed_Backend for base interface
