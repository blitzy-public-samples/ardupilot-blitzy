 * @brief MSP OSD backend for external OSD devices using MSP DisplayPort protocol
 * 
 * @details This file implements the MSP (MultiWii Serial Protocol) backend for
 *          the ArduPilot OSD system. It provides a bridge to external MSP-compatible
 *          OSD hardware devices that handle their own rendering and display.
 *          
 *          The MSP OSD backend is a minimal implementation that delegates actual
 *          display rendering to external hardware via the AP_MSP telemetry system.
 *          Unlike the MAX7456 backend which directly controls OSD hardware, this
 *          backend transmits OSD data through MSP protocol messages to compatible
 *          devices (e.g., MSP-based flight controller OSDs, digital FPV systems).
 *          
 *          Display coordinate system follows MSP protocol conventions:
 *          - Standard definition: typically 30 columns x 16 rows
 *          - High definition: typically 60 columns x 22 rows (HD variant)
 *          
 *          Integration: This backend works in conjunction with AP_MSP telemetry
 *          to transmit OSD panel data to external display hardware.
 * 
 * @note The actual rendering is performed by external MSP-compatible OSD hardware,
 *       not by the autopilot. This backend only formats and transmits the data.
 * 
 * @see AP_MSP for the underlying MSP protocol implementation
 * @see AP_OSD_Backend for the base OSD backend interface

/**
 * @class AP_OSD_MSP
 * @brief Minimal MSP backend implementation for external OSD devices
 * 
 * @details AP_OSD_MSP provides a lightweight OSD backend that transmits display
 *          data to external MSP-compatible OSD hardware via the MSP protocol.
 *          This backend implements the AP_OSD_Backend interface but delegates
 *          actual rendering to external devices.
 *          
 *          Architecture:
 *          - Inherits from AP_OSD_Backend for standard OSD interface
 *          - Integrates with AP_MSP telemetry system for data transmission
 *          - Handles parameter defaults via AP_Param system
 *          - Provides compatibility checking for OSD type selection
 *          
 *          Usage Pattern:
 *          1. Probed via factory method AP_OSD_MSP::probe()
 *          2. Initialized with init() to set up MSP communication
 *          3. OSD data transmitted through AP_MSP (rendering external)
 *          4. No local framebuffer management required
 *          
 *          This backend is minimal because:
 *          - No direct hardware control (external device handles this)
 *          - No framebuffer management (external device manages display)
 *          - No character rendering (external device performs rendering)
 *          
 *          The backend primarily exists to:
 *          - Establish compatibility with MSP OSD type configuration
 *          - Configure default OSD parameters for MSP devices
 *          - Provide standardized interface for MSP-based OSD systems
 * 
 * @note All actual display operations (write, flush, clear) are no-ops as
 *       rendering is handled by external MSP-compatible OSD hardware.
 * 
 * @warning The external MSP device must be properly configured to receive and
 *          display MSP DisplayPort messages. Incorrect MSP configuration will
 *          result in no OSD display despite successful probe and init.

     * @brief Factory method to probe and create an MSP OSD backend instance
     * 
     * @details This static factory method attempts to create an AP_OSD_MSP backend
