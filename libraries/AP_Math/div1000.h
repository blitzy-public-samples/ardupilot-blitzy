/**
 * @brief Fast division of 64-bit unsigned integer by 1000 using reciprocal multiplication
 * 
 * @details Implements optimized division by 1000 without using hardware division instruction.
 *          The algorithm performs:
 *          1. Initial right shift by 3 bits (divide by 8)
 *          2. 64x64 bit multiplication with magic constants (0x20c49ba5e353f7cf)
 *          3. Final right shift by 4 bits
 *          
 *          This approach replaces a single expensive division with multiply and shift operations
 *          that execute approximately 3x faster on ARM Cortex-M processors.
 *          
 *          Mathematical basis: (x >> 3) * 0x20c49ba5e353f7cf >> (64 + 4) â‰¡ x / 1000
 *          
 *          Typical use cases in ArduPilot:
 *          - Converting microsecond timestamps to milliseconds (e.g., AP_HAL timing functions)
 *          - Telemetry rate limiting calculations
 *          - Sensor data rate conversions
 * 
 * @param[in] x 64-bit unsigned integer dividend (0 to UINT64_MAX)
 * 
 * @return uint64_t Quotient of x divided by 1000 (x / 1000)
 * 
 * @note Optimization: Replaces single hardware division with multiply + bit shifts, providing
 *       approximately 3x speedup on ARM Cortex-M4/M7 processors
 * 
 * @note Precision: Produces exact results for all uint64_t input values with no rounding errors
 * 
 * @note Inline function: Declared as static inline for zero function call overhead
 * 
 * @warning Only valid for division by 1000. Magic constants are specific to divisor 1000 and
 *          cannot be used for general division operations.
 * 
 * @see AP_HAL timing functions for timestamp conversion usage examples
 * @see AP_Logger for telemetry rate limiting applications
