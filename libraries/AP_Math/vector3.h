 * @brief 3D vector class for spatial mathematics and physics calculations
 * 
 * @details This file provides a template-based 3D vector class used throughout ArduPilot
 *          for representing and manipulating spatial quantities with Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z).
 *          
 *          The Vector3 class implements comprehensive vector algebra including:
 *          - Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, scaling)
 *          - Vector products (dot product, cross product)
 *          - Geometric operations (magnitude, normalization, projection)
 *          - Rotations and coordinate transformations
 *          - Distance and angle calculations
 *          
 *          Common use cases include:
 *          - Position vectors (NED frame: North, East, Down in meters)
 *          - Velocity vectors (m/s in body or earth frame)
 *          - Acceleration vectors (m/sÂ² including gravity)
 *          - Force vectors (Newtons in body frame)
 *          - Rotation axes and angular velocity (rad/s)
 *          - Magnetic field vectors (Gauss or milliGauss)
 *          
 *          Coordinate frame conventions:
 *          - Body frame: x forward, y right, z down (right-hand rule)
 *          - NED frame: x north, y east, z down (earth-fixed)
 *          - ENU frame: x east, y north, z up (can be converted via rfu_to_frd())
 *          
 *          Vector identities (from Bill Perone's original implementation):
 *          - Dot product: a*b = 0 if vectors are orthogonal
 *          - Cross product: a%b = -b%a (anti-commutative)
 *          - Scalar triple product: a*(b%c) = volume of parallelepiped
 *          - Vector triple product: a%(b%c) = b*(a*c) - c*(a*b)
 *          
 * @note This implementation is derived from Bill Perone's vector classes with
 *       ArduPilot-specific enhancements for embedded systems and flight control.

/**
 * @class Vector3
 * @brief 3D vector template class with Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z)
 * 
 * @tparam T Numeric type for vector components (typically float or double)
 * 
 * @details Vector3 provides a comprehensive 3D vector implementation for spatial mathematics
 *          and physics calculations in ArduPilot. The class supports all standard vector
 *          algebra operations and is used extensively for position, velocity, acceleration,
 *          force, and rotation representations.
 *          
 *          Key capabilities:
 *          - Vector arithmetic: addition (+), subtraction (-), negation (-)
 *          - Scalar operations: multiplication (*), division (/)
 *          - Dot product: a * b (returns scalar)
 *          - Cross product: a % b (returns perpendicular vector)
 *          - Magnitude: length(), length_squared()
 *          - Normalization: normalize(), normalized()
 *          - Projections: project(), projected(), perpendicular()
 *          - Rotations: rotate(), rotate_inverse(), rotate_xy()
 *          - Geometric queries: angle(), distance_to_segment(), closest_point()
 *          - Coordinate conversions: rfu_to_frd(), xy()
 *          - Type conversions: tofloat(), todouble()
 *          
 *          Memory layout: Components x, y, z are stored contiguously in memory,
 *          allowing array-style access via operator[] and pointer casting for
 *          efficient operations.
 *          
 *          Thread safety: Individual Vector3 objects are NOT thread-safe. External
 *          synchronization required if shared between threads.
 *          
 *          Performance considerations:
 *          - length() involves sqrt() calculation - use length_squared() when possible
 *          - normalize() and normalized() fail silently for zero-length vectors
 *          - Cross product (%) allocates temporary return object
 *          - AP_INLINE_VECTOR_OPS can be defined for inline hot-path operations
 *          
 *          Common instantiations:
 *          - Vector3f: float precision (most common in flight code)
 *          - Vector3d: double precision (for high-accuracy calculations)
 *          - Vector3i: 16-bit integer
 *          - Vector3l: 32-bit integer
 *          
 * @note Derived from Bill Perone's vector classes with ArduPilot-specific enhancements
 *       for embedded flight control systems.
 * 
 * @warning normalize() returns zero vector if length is zero or near-zero, which may
 *          produce invalid results in subsequent calculations. Always check is_zero()
 *          before normalizing if zero-length vectors are possible.
 * 
 * @warning Floating-point equality operators (==, !=) use epsilon tolerance for float
 *          and double types, but exact comparison for integer types.
