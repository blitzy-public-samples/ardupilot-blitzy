/**
 * @file GCS_Copter.h
 * @brief Ground Control Station (GCS) interface for ArduCopter
 * 
 * @details This file defines the GCS_Copter class which provides the copter-specific
 *          implementation of the Ground Control Station interface. It manages MAVLink
 *          communication with ground control stations, telemetry streaming, and
 *          vehicle status reporting for multicopter vehicles.
 *          
 *          Architecture:
 *          - GCS_Copter extends the base GCS class with copter-specific behavior
 *          - Manages multiple MAVLink communication channels (radio, telemetry, USB, etc.)
 *          - Each channel is handled by a GCS_MAVLINK_Copter instance
 *          - Provides copter-specific MAVLink message handlers and status reporting
 *          - Coordinates telemetry streaming priorities with main flight control loop
 *          
 *          Relationship between classes:
 *          - GCS (base): Generic GCS interface for all vehicle types
 *          - GCS_Copter (this class): Copter-specific GCS manager/coordinator
 *          - GCS_MAVLINK_Copter: Per-channel MAVLink message handler implementation
 *          
 *          The GCS system operates with strict timing constraints to ensure flight
 *          control loop priority. Telemetry messages are only sent when sufficient
 *          time remains in the scheduler loop (see min_loop_time_remaining_for_message_send_us).
 * 
 * @note This is a safety-critical interface - MAVLink commands affect vehicle behavior
 * @warning Modifications to timing parameters can impact flight control stability

/**
 * @class GCS_Copter
 * @brief Copter-specific Ground Control Station interface manager
 * 
 * @details GCS_Copter provides the top-level GCS interface for multicopter vehicles,
 *          extending the generic GCS base class with copter-specific functionality:
 *          
 *          Key Responsibilities:
 *          - Manage multiple MAVLink communication channels (typically 4-6 channels)
 *          - Report copter-specific vehicle status (flight mode, sensor health, etc.)
 *          - Convert copter flight modes to MAVLink custom_mode encoding
 *          - Provide copter-specific MAV_TYPE and frame type identification
 *          - Control telemetry streaming timing to prioritize flight control
 *          - Create and manage GCS_MAVLINK_Copter backend instances for each channel
 *          
 *          Communication Architecture:
 *          - Each physical link (radio, telemetry, USB, etc.) has its own MAVLink channel
 *          - GCS_Copter coordinates these channels and provides vehicle-level context
 *          - Individual channels are handled by GCS_MAVLINK_Copter instances
 *          - Base GCS class provides common MAVLink protocol infrastructure
 *          
 *          Timing Constraints:
 *          - Flight control loop runs at 400Hz (2.5ms period) on most platforms
 *          - GCS messages only sent when >250Î¼s remains in loop (see min_loop_time_remaining)
 *          - This ensures telemetry never interferes with critical flight control
 *          
 *          MAVLink Protocol Support:
 *          - Supports MAVLink 1.0 and 2.0 protocols
 *          - Handles parameter protocol (read/write/list parameters)
 *          - Mission protocol (upload/download waypoint missions)
 *          - Command protocol (MAV_CMD_* commands for vehicle control)
 *          - Telemetry streaming (HEARTBEAT, ATTITUDE, GPS, etc.)
 *          - File transfer protocol (FTP for logs, terrain data)
 * 
 * @note Friend class Copter allows main vehicle to access internal channel array
 * @warning This is a safety-critical class - handles vehicle control commands

     *          
     *          Technical Implementation:

     *

     *          - GCS telemetry is important but not flight-critical
     *          - If loop overruns occur, flight control becomes unstable
     *          
     *          Timing Budget:
     *          - 250Î¼s minimum remaining time ensures GCS messages don't cause overruns
     *          - Typical MAVLink message transmission: 50-200Î¼s depending on message size

     *          
     *          This value is smaller than some other vehicle types:
