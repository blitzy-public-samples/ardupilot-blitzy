 * @brief Standby mode management for ArduCopter
 * 
 * @details This file implements the standby mode functionality for ArduCopter.
 *          Standby is a special armed state where motors are stopped but the vehicle
 *          remains armed, maintaining sensor fusion and ready for rapid flight resumption.
 *          
 *          Standby Mode Characteristics:
 *          - Vehicle remains armed (different from disarmed state)
 *          - Motors are commanded to zero thrust (motor shutdown sequence)
 *          - All control loops continue running to prevent integrator windup
 *          - EKF and sensor fusion remain active for state estimation health
 *          - Power consumption reduced compared to active flight
 *          - Enables rapid transition to flight without rearm sequence
 *          
 *          Standby is typically entered when:
 *          - Vehicle is armed but throttle is at zero for extended period
 *          - Flight mode commands standby (e.g., boat mode on water)
 *          - External command requests standby state
 *          - Auto-disarm timer has not yet expired
 *          
 *          Standby is exited when:
 *          - Pilot increases throttle above threshold
 *          - Flight mode changes requiring active flight
 *          - Vehicle is manually disarmed
 *          
 *          Power Conservation Strategy:
 *          - Motors consume no power (ESCs at zero throttle)
 *          - IMU and sensors remain at full rate for EKF health
 *          - Telemetry and logging continue at normal rates
 *          - Control calculations continue to prevent mode transition delays
 *          
 *          Sensor Monitoring During Standby:
 *          - IMU data continues to update at full scheduler rate (400Hz typical)
 *          - GPS, compass, and barometer maintain normal update rates
 *          - EKF continues state estimation to prevent divergence
 *          - Ensures zero-latency transition back to active flight
 *          - Prevents need for EKF reinitialization on flight resumption
 * 
 * @note Standby is distinct from disarmed state - vehicle is still armed and
 *       can transition to flight immediately without pre-arm checks
 * 
 * @warning Standby mode keeps vehicle armed. All safety precautions for armed
 *          vehicles apply. Props can spin with throttle increase.

/**
 * @brief Update standby mode controller states at high frequency
 * 
 * @details This function runs at approximately 100Hz when standby mode is active
 *          to continuously reset control loop integrators and error accumulators.
 *          The high update rate (100Hz) is necessary to prevent any significant
 *          build-up in controller states during the standby period.
 *          
 *          Motor Shutdown Sequence:
 *          When standby becomes active, this function ensures motors remain at
 *          zero thrust by resetting all control outputs. The motor mixing and
 *          output stages receive zero thrust commands, causing ESCs to command
 *          zero throttle while remaining armed and ready.
 *          
 *          Control Loop Reset Strategy:
 *          - Attitude rate controller I-terms reset to zero (prevents rate windup)
 *          - Yaw target and rate reset (prevents heading error accumulation)
 *          - Position controller errors reset in North-East-Up frame (prevents
 *            position error integration that would cause sudden movements on exit)
 *          
 *          Systems Disabled During Standby:
 *          The following safety and learning systems are disabled while in standby
 *          to prevent false triggers and inappropriate learning:
 *          - crash_check: Disabled to prevent false crash detection at zero throttle
 *          - thrust_loss_check: Disabled as intentional zero thrust would trigger false positive
 *          - parachute_check: Disabled as vehicle is not flying
 *          - hover_throttle_learn: Disabled to prevent learning zero throttle as hover point
 *          - landing_detection: Disabled as standby can occur in flight (e.g., on boat)
 *          
 *          These systems are disabled in the main scheduler/mode code, not within
 *          this function. This function focuses solely on resetting control states.
 *          
 *          Conditions for Function Execution:
 *          This function only executes when standby_active flag is true. The flag
 *          is set by the active flight mode or main vehicle code when standby
 *          conditions are met. Early return when not in standby ensures zero
 *          performance impact during normal flight operations.
 *          
 *          Rapid Flight Resumption Design:
 *          By maintaining sensor fusion (EKF) and continuously resetting control
 *          errors, standby mode enables instant transition back to active flight:
 *          1. No EKF reinitialization needed (already converged and healthy)
 *          2. No integrator windup to unwind (continuously reset during standby)
 *          3. No position/velocity errors accumulated (reset each cycle)
 *          4. Controllers start from clean state (zero errors, zero I-terms)
 *          5. Pilot simply adds throttle and vehicle responds immediately
 *          
 *          Power Conservation Balance:
 *          Standby mode balances power savings with readiness:
 *          - Major savings: Motors stopped (largest power consumer in hover)
 *          - Maintained: Full rate IMU/sensors for EKF health (minimal power)
 *          - Maintained: Control calculations (CPU power, but essential for instant response)
 *          - Result: Significantly longer armed time before battery depletion,
 *            while maintaining instant flight capability
 * 
 * @note Called at approximately 100Hz (10ms period) from main scheduler when
 *       standby_active flag is true. High rate prevents integrator buildup.
 * 
 * @note The standby_active flag is managed by flight mode code and vehicle state
 *       machine, not by this function. This function only responds to the flag.
 * 
 * @warning This function must be called frequently (100Hz) when in standby to
 *          prevent control state accumulation. Infrequent calls could cause
 *          sudden vehicle movements when exiting standby due to accumulated errors.

    // yaw corrections when returning to flight. Resetting to current heading ensures
    // smooth flight resumption regardless of heading changes during standby period.

    // or be moved by external forces. These position changes should not trigger
    // aggressive position corrections when flight resumes. The vehicle will establish
    // new position targets based on post-standby state rather than trying to return
    // to pre-standby position. This is especially important for standby on moving
    // platforms (boats, vehicles) where large position deltas are expected and normal.

    // Note: Motor outputs are managed elsewhere in the motor library and flight mode code.
    // This function focuses on control loop state management. Motors receive zero thrust
    // commands through the normal motor mixing pipeline when standby is active.
    
    // Note: EKF and sensor fusion continue running at full rate (not managed here).
    // IMU updates at 400Hz typical, GPS/compass/baro at their normal rates. This ensures
    // state estimation remains healthy and converged, enabling instant flight resumption.
    
    // Note: The following systems are disabled elsewhere when standby_active is true:
    // - crash_check() skipped to prevent false crash detection
    // - thrust_loss_check() skipped to prevent false thrust loss detection
    // - parachute_check() skipped as vehicle is not in flight
    // - update_throttle_hover() skipped to prevent learning zero throttle
    // - landing detection skipped as standby can occur in flight (boat mode)
