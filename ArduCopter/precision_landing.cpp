 * @brief Precision landing system integration for ArduCopter
 * 
 * @details This file provides the integration layer between ArduCopter vehicle code
 *          and the AC_PrecLand library, enabling high-accuracy landings using visual
 *          or infrared beacon tracking.
 * 
 *          Precision landing improves landing accuracy from meters (GPS-based) to
 *          centimeters by tracking visual targets such as IR-LOCK beacons, AprilTags,
 *          or other fiducial markers during the descent phase.
 * 
 *          The AC_PrecLand library manages the precision landing state machine with
 *          the following states:
 *          - DISABLED: Precision landing inactive
 *          - ENABLED: Actively searching for and tracking landing target
 *          - RETRY_DESCEND: Lost target, descending to reacquire
 *          - DESCENDING: Target acquired, performing precision descent
 *          - FINAL_DESCENT: Very close to target, final approach phase
 * 
 *          During precision landing, the vehicle:
 *          1. Searches for the landing target using onboard sensors (IR-LOCK, camera)
 *          2. Estimates target position in vehicle body frame
 *          3. Commands position corrections to center over the target
 *          4. Descends while maintaining target alignment
 *          5. Falls back to normal GPS landing if target is lost beyond retry threshold
 * 
 *          Integration points:
 *          - Rangefinder provides accurate altitude-above-target for final descent
 *          - Position controller (AC_PosControl) executes horizontal corrections
 *          - Land mode calls update_precland() to enable precision landing behavior
 *          - Failsafe: Reverts to normal GPS/barometric landing if target tracking fails
 * 
 *          Common sensor configurations:
 *          - IR-LOCK sensor tracking infrared beacon (most common)
 *          - Downward camera with AprilTag detection (requires companion computer)
 *          - Other vision-based target tracking systems via MAVLink LANDING_TARGET
 * 
 * @note Precision landing requires PLnd parameters to be configured and a compatible
 *       sensor (IR-LOCK or vision system) to be installed and calibrated
 * 
 * @warning Target tracking can be affected by lighting conditions, target visibility,
 *          and sensor field of view. Always have sufficient altitude for failover
 *          to normal landing if target is lost
 *

/**
 * @brief Initialize the precision landing subsystem
 * 
 * @details Initializes the AC_PrecLand library with the appropriate update rate
 *          based on the scheduler loop frequency. This function is called once
 *          during vehicle initialization to set up the precision landing system.
 * 
 *          The precision landing system runs its target detection and position
 *          estimation algorithms at a rate determined by:
 *          - Desired rate: 400Hz (specified in scheduler_tasks table)
 *          - Actual rate: MIN(400Hz, scheduler loop rate)
 * 
 *          The actual update rate is limited by the main scheduler loop rate to
 *          prevent the precision landing system from attempting to run faster
 *          than the scheduler can support. On most flight controllers, the main
 *          loop runs at 400Hz, so precision landing will run at 400Hz. On slower
 *          boards, it will run at the maximum available loop rate.
 * 
 *          Rate limiting rationale:
 *          - Higher rates improve target tracking responsiveness and accuracy
 *          - Cannot exceed scheduler rate (would skip updates or cause timing issues)
 *          - 400Hz matches the attitude controller rate for smooth control integration
 * 
 *          After initialization, the precision landing system:
 *          - Configures sensor interfaces (IR-LOCK, camera, MAVLink LANDING_TARGET)
 *          - Initializes state machine to DISABLED state
 *          - Sets up target position estimator and filtering
 *          - Prepares for target acquisition when enabled by flight mode
 * 
 * @note This function is called automatically during vehicle initialization in
 *       system.cpp. No manual initialization is required.
 * 
 * @note The AC_PrecLand library must be compiled in (AC_PRECLAND_ENABLED) for
 *       this function to be available
 * 
 * @see Copter::init_ardupilot() in system.cpp for initialization sequence
 * @see Copter::update_precland() for periodic update function
 * @see scheduler_tasks table in Copter.cpp for task scheduling configuration

/**
 * @brief Update the precision landing system with current sensor data
 * 
 * @details Performs periodic update of the precision landing subsystem, passing
 *          current rangefinder altitude data for accurate height-above-target
 *          estimation. This function is called every scheduler loop iteration
 *          (typically 400Hz) when precision landing is enabled.
 * 
 *          The precision landing system update performs:
 *          1. Target detection: Processes sensor data (IR-LOCK, camera) to locate target
 *          2. Target position estimation: Converts sensor measurements to body-frame position
 *          3. Position filtering: Applies Kalman filtering to smooth noisy target detections
 *          4. Target tracking: Updates target position estimate over time
 *          5. State machine updates: Manages precision landing states (searching, descending, etc.)
 *          6. Landing corrections: Calculates position adjustments to center over target
 * 
 *          Rangefinder integration:
 *          - Rangefinder provides accurate altitude above the landing target surface
 *          - More accurate than barometer for final approach (centimeter vs meter precision)
 *          - Glitch-protected altitude (rangefinder_state.alt_cm_glitch_protected) filters
 *            out spurious readings from sensor noise or ground reflections
 *          - Rangefinder validity check (rangefinder_alt_ok()) ensures data quality
 *          - If rangefinder unavailable or invalid, system uses barometric altitude (less accurate)
 * 
 *          Altitude data usage:
 *          - Passed to AC_PrecLand::update() for height-above-target calculations
 *          - Used to adjust target position estimates based on sensor field of view
 *          - Critical for final descent phase when precision is most important
 *          - If rangefinder_alt_ok() returns false, altitude parameter is ignored by library
 * 
 *          Target tracking workflow:
 *          - Sensor detects target beacon/marker in image or IR field
 *          - Raw sensor angle measurements converted to position using altitude
 *          - Position estimates filtered using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
 *          - Filtered position sent to position controller for correction commands
 *          - Process repeats every update cycle for continuous target tracking
 * 
 *          Failover behavior:
 *          - If target lost temporarily: System enters RETRY_DESCEND state
 *          - If target lost beyond retry threshold: Falls back to normal landing
 *          - Normal landing uses GPS position hold during descent
 *          - Ensures safe landing even if precision system fails
 * 
 *          Performance characteristics:
 *          - Update rate: 400Hz (same as attitude controller)
 *          - Target position accuracy: Typically <10cm with good sensor data
 *          - Landing accuracy: <20cm with IR-LOCK in good conditions
 *          - Comparison: GPS landing accuracy typically 1-3 meters
 * 
 * @note This function is called automatically by the scheduler task system at the
 *       configured rate (typically 400Hz). Flight modes that use precision landing
 *       (primarily Land mode) will activate the system which then runs autonomously.
 * 
 * @note The rangefinder altitude is only used when rangefinder_alt_ok() returns true,
 *       indicating valid rangefinder data is available. Otherwise, barometric altitude
 *       is used by the AC_PrecLand library.
 * 
 * @warning Precision landing performance depends heavily on:
 *          - Target visibility (lighting conditions for cameras, line-of-sight for IR)
 *          - Rangefinder accuracy and update rate
 *          - Vehicle stability (excessive vibration degrades tracking)
 *          - Sensor mounting alignment (must point straight down)
 * 
 * @see rangefinder_state.alt_cm_glitch_protected - Filtered rangefinder altitude in cm
 * @see rangefinder_alt_ok() - Validates rangefinder data quality
 * @see AC_PrecLand::update() - Core precision landing library update function
 * @see mode_land.cpp - Land mode integration with precision landing
