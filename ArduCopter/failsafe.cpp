 * @brief Core failsafe system for detecting main loop lockup and preventing uncontrolled flight
 * 
 * @details This file implements the primary failsafe mechanism that monitors the main scheduler
 *          loop execution and takes emergency action if the main loop stops running. This is
 *          a safety-critical component that acts as the last line of defense against firmware
 *          lockups, infinite loops, or CPU stalls that could result in loss of vehicle control.
 * 
 *          The failsafe system operates at the hardware timer interrupt level (1kHz) independently
 *          of the main loop, allowing it to detect and respond to main loop failures even when
 *          the main flight control code has stopped executing.
 * 
 *          FAILSAFE HIERARCHY AND ARCHITECTURE:
 *          
 *          ArduCopter implements multiple layers of failsafe protection:
 *          
 *          1. Main Loop Lockup Failsafe (THIS FILE - Highest Priority)
 *             - Detects complete scheduler failure
 *             - Monitors via hardware timer interrupt at 1kHz
 *             - Triggers if main loop doesn't run for 2 seconds
 *             - Action: Reduces motors to minimum, then disarms
 *             - Cannot be disabled when motors armed
 *          
 *          2. Radio/RC Failsafe (Copter.cpp - radio_failsafe())
 *             - Detects loss of RC transmitter signal
 *             - Configured via FS_THR_ENABLE parameter
 *             - Actions: RTL, Land, Continue, or SmartRTL
 *             - Requires valid RC connection restoration to clear
 *          
 *          3. GCS Failsafe (GCS_Copter.cpp - gcs_failsafe_check())
 *             - Detects loss of ground control station telemetry
 *             - Configured via FS_GCS_ENABLE parameter
 *             - Actions: RTL, Land, Continue, or SmartRTL
 *             - Independent timeout from radio failsafe
 *          
 *          4. Battery Failsafe (battery.cpp - battery_failsafe())
 *             - Monitors battery voltage and remaining capacity
 *             - Two-stage: Low Battery (warning) and Critical Battery (action)
 *             - Configured via BATT_LOW_VOLT, BATT_CRT_VOLT, BATT_FS_LOW_ACT
 *             - Actions: RTL, Land, or SmartRTL
 *          
 *          5. EKF/DCM Failsafe (ekf_check.cpp - ekf_check())
 *             - Detects loss of position/velocity estimation
 *             - Monitors EKF variance and health flags
 *             - Action: Land mode (immediate controlled descent)
 *             - Critical for preventing flyaways with bad GPS
 *          
 *          6. Terrain Failsafe (terrain.cpp)
 *             - Detects loss of terrain data during terrain following
 *             - Action: RTL or Land depending on configuration
 *          
 *          7. Crash Check Failsafe (crash_check.cpp)
 *             - Detects vehicle crash or flip during flight
 *             - Monitors angle, angular rate, and lack of altitude change
 *             - Action: Immediate disarm to prevent ground damage
 *          
 *          8. Parachute Failsafe (parachute.cpp)
 *             - Emergency parachute deployment on critical failures
 *             - Triggered by severe attitude errors or crash detection
 *          
 *          9. ADSB Failsafe (avoidance_adsb.cpp - adsb_failsafe())
 *             - Collision avoidance with manned aircraft
 *             - Monitors ADSB transponder data for traffic conflicts
 *             - Action: Automated avoidance maneuvers
 *          
 *          FAILSAFE CASCADE LOGIC:
 *          
 *          When multiple failsafes trigger simultaneously, ArduCopter follows this priority:
 *          1. Main Loop Lockup (THIS FILE) - Always highest priority, forces disarm
 *          2. Crash Detected - Immediate disarm overrides other actions
 *          3. EKF Failsafe - Forces Land mode to prevent flyaway
 *          4. Battery Critical - Overrides radio/GCS failsafes
 *          5. Radio/GCS Failsafe - User-configured recovery action
 *          6. Battery Low - Warning only, allows continued flight
 *

/**
 * @brief Temporarily disable main loop lockup failsafe monitoring
 * 
 * @details Deactivates failsafe monitoring to prevent false triggers during intentional

 *          loop for extended periods, such as:
 *          
 *          - Compass calibration (rotating vehicle while sampling magnetometer)
 *          - ESC calibration (sending specific PWM sequences to ESCs)
 *          - Flash memory operations (erasing or writing large blocks)
 *          - Parameter storage writes (EEPROM operations)
 *          - Firmware update operations
 *          
 *          The failsafe should be re-enabled with failsafe_enable() immediately after
 *          completing the blocking operation to restore safety protection.
 *          
 *          SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
 *          - This function should NEVER be called while motors are armed and flying
 *          - Disabling failsafe removes protection against firmware crashes and infinite loops
 *          - Always pair with failsafe_enable() to re-activate protection
 *          - Keep the disabled period as short as possible
 * 
 * @note Does not reset any timers or clear failsafe state. Simply stops monitoring
 *       until re-enabled with failsafe_enable().
 * 
 * @warning SAFETY CRITICAL: Disabling this failsafe removes the last line of defense
 *          against main loop lockups. Only disable for well-tested, time-bounded
 *          operations that are known to exceed 2 seconds of main loop delay.
 *          
 *          DO NOT disable during armed flight operations. Doing so could result in
 *          loss of vehicle control if the firmware crashes, with no automatic recovery.

/**
 * @brief Monitor main scheduler loop execution and trigger emergency shutdown if loop stops
 * 
 * @details This is the core failsafe monitoring function that detects main loop lockups
 *          and takes emergency action to prevent uncontrolled flight. It is called from
 *          a hardware timer interrupt at 1kHz (every 1 millisecond), completely independent
 *          of the main scheduler loop, allowing it to detect and respond to main loop
 *          failures even when the main flight control code has stopped executing.
 *          
 *          DETECTION ALGORITHM:
 *          
 *          The function monitors the scheduler tick counter which increments each time
 *          the main loop completes a cycle. By comparing the current tick value with
 *          the previous value stored in failsafe_last_ticks, it can determine if the
 *          main loop is still running:
 *          
 *          1. Ticks incrementing = Main loop is running normally (update timestamp, clear failsafe)
 *          2. Ticks static for 2+ seconds = Main loop has stopped (trigger emergency action)
 *          
 *          FAILSAFE TRIGGER SEQUENCE:
 *          
 *          When main loop stops for 2 seconds:
 *          - Set in_failsafe flag to true
 *          - Reduce motors to minimum output (allows controlled descent, maintains logging)
 *          - Log FAILSAFE_OCCURRED error to dataflash for post-flight analysis
 *          
 *          After 1 additional second (3 seconds total lockup):
 *          - Force motors to disarm
 *          - Continue disarming every 1 second while loop remains locked
 *          
 *          RECOVERY BEHAVIOR:
 *          
 *          If the main loop resumes execution while in failsafe state:
 *          - Clear in_failsafe flag
 *          - Log FAILSAFE_RESOLVED error
 *          - Resume normal operation (main loop takes over motor control)
 *          
 *          TIMING REQUIREMENTS:
 *          
 *          - Called at 1kHz from timer interrupt (cannot be preempted by main loop)
 *          - Must execute in < 1ms to avoid interrupt overrun
 *          - Uses microsecond timestamps to avoid rollover issues
 *          - 2-second timeout chosen to avoid false triggers from normal operations
 * 
 * @note This function runs in INTERRUPT CONTEXT at 1kHz. It must:
 *       - Execute quickly (< 1ms)
 *       - Not block or wait
 *       - Not call complex functions that could deadlock
 *       - Use only interrupt-safe operations
 * 
 * @warning SAFETY CRITICAL FUNCTION - This is the last line of defense against firmware
 *          crashes, infinite loops, and CPU stalls. Any modifications must be exhaustively
 *          tested in SITL and on hardware.
 *          
 *          FALSE NEGATIVE (failing to detect lockup): Vehicle continues flying with locked
 *          firmware, potentially leading to crash or flyaway.
 *          
 *          FALSE POSITIVE (incorrect lockup detection): Motors disarm during normal flight,
 *          causing crash from altitude.
 *          
 *          Both failure modes are catastrophic. The 2-second timeout is chosen to balance
 *          these risks - long enough to avoid false positives from normal operations, short
 *          enough to disarm before vehicle enters uncontrolled flight.
 * 
 * @warning This function is called from TIMER INTERRUPT CONTEXT. Do not add code that:
 *          - Allocates memory
 *          - Performs I/O operations
 *          - Acquires locks that main loop might hold
 *          - Calls complex library functions
 *          - Takes more than a few microseconds to execute

/**
 * @brief Perform Advanced Failsafe System (AFS) monitoring checks
 * 
 * @details The Advanced Failsafe System provides additional safety monitoring beyond
 *          the basic failsafes, with features designed for regulatory compliance and
 *          commercial operations. When enabled via AP_COPTER_ADVANCED_FAILSAFE_ENABLED,
 *          this function integrates the AFS library checks into the Copter failsafe
 *          monitoring system.
 *          
 *          AFS monitors additional failure conditions including:
 *          - Geofence breaches (beyond basic fence system)
 *          - Altitude limit violations
 *          - GPS quality degradation
 *          - RC signal quality issues
 *          - Manual recovery enable/disable
 *          - Emergency termination conditions
 *          
 *          The AFS system can trigger more aggressive actions than standard failsafes,
 *          including forced termination (motor shutdown) for regulatory compliance in
 *          controlled airspace or populated areas.
 *          
 *          INTEGRATION WITH OTHER FAILSAFES:
 *          
 *          AFS operates independently but can interact with other failsafe systems:
 *          - AFS termination overrides all other failsafe actions
 *          - AFS can be configured to require manual recovery (no auto-RTL)
 *          - AFS monitors include radio failsafe timing via last_radio_update_ms
 * 
 * @note This function is only compiled when AP_COPTER_ADVANCED_FAILSAFE_ENABLED
 *       is defined in the build configuration. Most users do not enable AFS unless
 *       required for specific regulatory or commercial operation requirements.
 * 
 * @warning AFS can trigger FORCED TERMINATION which immediately disarms motors
 *          regardless of altitude or flight condition. This is by design for
 *          regulatory compliance but can result in crash from altitude. Only enable
 *          AFS if you understand and accept this behavior.
