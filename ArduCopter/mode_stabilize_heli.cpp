 * @brief Stabilize flight mode implementation for traditional helicopters
 * 
 * @details This file implements the Stabilize flight mode specifically adapted for
 *          traditional helicopters (HELI_FRAME configuration). Unlike multicopter
 *          stabilize mode which controls motor thrust, this variant manages:
 *          
 *          - **Collective Pitch Control**: Throttle input controls collective pitch
 *            angle of main rotor blades rather than motor speed, providing vertical
 *            thrust control through blade angle of attack changes
 *          
 *          - **Swashplate Mixing**: Cyclic (roll/pitch) and collective commands are
 *            mixed through the swashplate mechanism (via AC_AttitudeControl_Heli)
 *            to control individual blade pitch throughout the rotor rotation cycle
 *          
 *          - **Tail Rotor Heading Hold**: Yaw rate commands drive tail rotor collective
 *            to counteract main rotor torque and maintain heading, with special handling
 *            for autorotation scenarios where tail rotor authority is limited
 *          
 *          - **Rotor Speed Governor**: Motor interlock and spool state management
 *            coordinates with external governor (ESC or separate controller) to
 *            maintain constant head speed independent of collective pitch changes
 *          
 *          - **Autorotation Compatibility**: Unlike multicopters, does not reset
 *            attitude targets when motors are not spooled up while flying, allowing
 *            continued attitude control during autorotation descent
 *          
 *          The stabilize mode provides rate-stabilized control where pilot stick inputs
 *          command lean angles (roll/pitch) and yaw rate, while the attitude controller
 *          maintains those targets using helicopter-specific control mixing.

/**
 * @brief Initialize stabilize flight mode for traditional helicopters
 * 
 * @details Configures the helicopter control system for stabilize mode operation.
 *          This initialization is called when the pilot switches into stabilize mode,
 *          NOT at vehicle startup. Key initialization:
 *          
 *          - **Collective Pitch Scaling**: Enables stabilize-specific collective pitch
 *            scaling (stab_col mode) which uses a restricted collective range optimized
 *            for manual stabilized flight, typically centered around hover collective
 *            with symmetric up/down authority
 *          
 *          Unlike multicopter stabilize initialization, this does NOT:
 *          - Reset motor outputs (servos maintain position for pre-flight checks)
 *          - Initialize throttle curves (governor manages rotor speed independently)
 *          - Set motor mixing (swashplate mixing is always active in helicopter)
 *          
 *          The lightweight initialization reflects that traditional helicopters maintain
 *          servo positions and rotor speed management across mode transitions, with only
 *          collective scaling and control response characteristics changing between modes.
 * 
 * @param[in] ignore_checks If true, skip pre-arm and safety checks (used for forced
 *                          mode changes during failsafe or emergency situations)
 * 
 * @return true Always returns true for stabilize mode as it has no prerequisites
 *              (stabilize is the fallback mode and must always be enterable)
 * 
 * @note This function is called during mode transitions, not at vehicle boot
 * @note Stabilize mode is the default safe mode for helicopters and must succeed
 * @warning Do not add complex initialization logic here as it runs during mode changes
 *          which may occur during time-critical flight situations
 * 
 * @see Copter::InputManagerHeli::set_use_stab_col() - Collective pitch scaling
 * @see ModeStabilize_Heli::run() - Main stabilize mode execution

/**
 * @brief Execute stabilize flight mode control loop for traditional helicopters
 * 
 * @details Runs the main stabilize controller implementing rate-stabilized attitude control
 *          adapted for traditional helicopter control mechanics. This function processes
 *          pilot inputs and commands the helicopter attitude control system using
 *          helicopter-specific control allocation.
 *          
 *          **Control Flow**:
 *          1. Apply SIMPLE mode coordinate transformation to pilot inputs if enabled
 *          2. Convert pilot cyclic stick inputs to target lean angles (roll/pitch)
 *          3. Convert pilot pedal input to target yaw rate
 *          4. Scale pilot collective stick input to collective pitch angle
 *          5. Manage rotor spool state and motor interlock based on arm status
 *          6. Handle attitude controller state based on spool conditions
 *          7. Command attitude controller with helicopter-specific mixing
 *          8. Output collective pitch command to swashplate
 *          
 *          **Helicopter-Specific Control Characteristics**:
 *          
 *          - **Swashplate Mixing**: Target roll/pitch/collective are mixed through
 *            AC_AttitudeControl_Heli which implements CCPM (Cyclic/Collective Pitch Mixing)
 *            or mechanical mixing to translate control commands into individual servo
 *            positions for the swashplate mechanism
 *          
 *          - **Collective Pitch Control**: Unlike multicopter throttle which directly
 *            controls motor speed, collective pitch changes the angle of attack of all
 *            main rotor blades simultaneously while rotor speed is maintained constant
 *            by a separate governor (typically in the ESC)
 *          
 *          - **Tail Rotor Heading Hold**: Yaw rate commands control tail rotor collective
 *            pitch to generate anti-torque thrust. The tail rotor counteracts main rotor
 *            torque reaction and provides directional control
 *          
 *          - **Autorotation Handling**: Servos continue to move even when motors are not
 *            at full speed (disarmed or autorotation) to allow realistic servo movement
 *            during ground checks and maintain attitude control authority during engine-off
 *            descent. This differs from multicopters which zero outputs when disarmed
 *          
 *          - **Rotor Speed Governor**: Motor interlock enables the external governor to
 *            spool up and maintain rotor speed. Spool state progresses through GROUND_IDLE
 *            to THROTTLE_UNLIMITED only after motor interlock is enabled, coordinating
 *            with the governor's speed control loop
 *          
 *          - **Integrator Management**: Rate controller integrators are reset or smoothed
 *            based on spool state to prevent integrator windup during ground operations
 *            or spoolup, with special handling for leaky integrator configurations that
 *            allow continued integration during autorotation practice
 *          
 *          **Spool State Handling**:
 *          - SHUT_DOWN: Motors stopped, reset yaw and all integrators
 *          - GROUND_IDLE: On ground or autorotation practice, reset yaw and smooth integrators
 *          - SPOOLING_UP/DOWN: Transient states, maintain current targets
 *          - THROTTLE_UNLIMITED: Full flight authority, smooth integrators if landed
 * 
 * @return void
 * 
 * @note Must be called at 100Hz or higher for stable control (typically 400Hz main loop)
 * @note Cyclic inputs are scaled by lean_angle_max parameter (typically 45 degrees)
 * @note Collective scaling uses stabilize-specific range set during init()
 * 
 * @warning Servo outputs remain active when disarmed for ground checks; ensure rotor
 *          is not installed or area is clear during bench testing
 * @warning Autorotation mode allows attitude control without motor power; do not assume
 *          motors stopped means servos are inactive
 * @warning Motor interlock must be enabled separately from arming for rotor spoolup;
 *          arming alone will not start the rotor

    //
    // 1. **Autorotation Flight**: During engine-off autorotation descent (emergency procedure),
    //    the pilot must maintain full cyclic (roll/pitch) and pedal (yaw) authority to control
    //    the unpowered descent and landing. Resetting attitude targets would be catastrophic.
    //
    // 2. **Ground Operational Checks**: Servos must move realistically while disarmed to allow
    //    pilots to verify swashplate movement, servo direction, and control throw during
    //    pre-flight inspections without spinning the rotor.
    //
    // Unlike multicopters which zero all outputs when disarmed, helicopters keep swashplate
    // servos and tail rotor servo active, moving in response to stick inputs. Only motor output
