 * @brief Pre-takeoff safety validation and motor spool-up verification
 * 
 * @details This file implements safety-critical takeoff checks that validate
 *          vehicle readiness before allowing rotor spool-up and flight. The primary
 *          function monitors ESC telemetry to ensure motors are spinning at expected
 *          RPM levels before clearing the motor spool-up block.
 *          
 *          These checks prevent takeoff attempts with:
 *          - ESCs not responding or providing telemetry
 *          - Motors spinning too slowly (potential mechanical binding)
 *          - Motors spinning too fast (potential ESC misconfiguration)
 *          
 *          The checks are applied immediately after arming and must pass before
 *          the vehicle transitions from land_complete state to flying state.
 * 
 * @note This module is only active when ESC telemetry is available and configured
 *       (HAL_WITH_ESC_TELEM) and for non-helicopter frames
 * 
 * @warning Modifying these checks affects flight safety. Disabling or weakening
 *          takeoff validation can allow flight with malfunctioning ESCs or motors.

/**
 * @brief Validates takeoff readiness by verifying ESC telemetry and motor RPM levels
 * 
 * @details This safety-critical function monitors ESC telemetry to ensure all motors
 *          are spinning within the expected RPM range before allowing takeoff. It sets
 *          or clears the motor spool-up block flag based on the validation results.
 *          
 *          The function implements a state machine that:
 *          1. Automatically blocks motors when disarmed (prevents uncommanded spoolup)
 *          2. Validates ESC telemetry is active after arming
 *          3. Verifies motor RPM is within configured min/max range
 *          4. Clears block only when all conditions are met
 *          5. Once cleared, remains unblocked until disarming
 *          
 *          Safety Features:
 *          - Blocks spoolup if ESC telemetry is not active (potential wiring/config issue)
 *          - Blocks spoolup if RPM is below minimum (potential binding, bad motor, or ESC issue)
 *          - Blocks spoolup if RPM is above maximum (potential ESC misconfiguration)
 *          - Provides pilot feedback via GCS messages every 5 seconds during blocking
 *          - Automatically unblocks when vehicle is already flying (allows mid-flight rearm)
 *          
 *          Configuration Parameters:
 *          - TKOFF_RPM_MIN (g2.takeoff_rpm_min): Minimum acceptable motor RPM
 *          - TKOFF_RPM_MAX (g2.takeoff_rpm_max): Maximum acceptable motor RPM
 *          - Set TKOFF_RPM_MIN <= 0 to disable takeoff checks entirely
 * 
 * @note This check is only active when ESC telemetry is compiled in (HAL_WITH_ESC_TELEM)
 *       and for non-helicopter frames (FRAME_CONFIG != HELI_FRAME)
 * 
 * @note The check can only block motors immediately after arming. Once unblocked,
 *       it will not reblock until the next arming cycle. This prevents mid-flight
 *       motor cutouts if telemetry is temporarily lost.
 * 
 * @note Called at main loop rate (typically 400Hz) when armed and on ground
 * 
 * @warning This is a flight-critical safety check. Disabling or bypassing this check
 *          (by setting TKOFF_RPM_MIN <= 0) removes protection against:
 *          - ESC configuration errors
 *          - Motor binding or mechanical failures
 *          - ESC telemetry wiring failures
 * 
 * @warning Modifying the one-time block behavior could cause motors to cut out
 *          in flight if telemetry is lost temporarily

    // 1. Feature is disabled (TKOFF_RPM_MIN <= 0) - User has chosen to disable RPM validation
    // 2. Vehicle is already flying (!ap.land_complete) - Allow mid-flight rearm without blocking

    //    emergency disarm) which would cause an immediate crash

    // ONE-TIME BLOCK LOGIC: If motors have already been unblocked, skip further checks
    // This implements a one-time validation strategy:
    // - Checks are only enforced immediately after arming (when block is still set)
