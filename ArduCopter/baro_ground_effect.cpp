 * @brief Barometer ground effect compensation and EKF terrain height management
 * 
 * @details This file implements ground effect detection and compensation for
 *          barometric altitude measurements. During hover near the ground, rotor
 *          downwash creates a high-pressure region beneath the vehicle that affects
 *          barometric pressure readings, causing altitude estimation errors. This
 *          system detects takeoff and landing phases and signals the EKF to apply
 *          appropriate compensation to maintain accurate altitude hold in ground effect.
 *          
 *          Ground Effect Physics:
 *          - Rotor downwash creates increased static pressure beneath vehicle
 *          - Barometric altimeters interpret higher pressure as lower altitude
 *          - Effect most pronounced within 1-2 rotor diameters of ground
 *          - Can cause 0.5-2m altitude errors during low hover
 *          
 *          Detection Strategy:
 *          - Monitors vehicle state for imminent takeoff or landing
 *          - Uses altitude, velocity, attitude, and throttle signals
 *          - Signals EKF to adjust barometer weighting and bias estimation
 *          
 * @note This is safety-critical code affecting altitude hold accuracy near ground

/**
 * @brief Detect ground effect conditions and signal EKF for barometer compensation
 * 
 * @details This function analyzes vehicle state to determine if the multicopter is in
 *          or approaching ground effect conditions during takeoff or landing. Ground
 *          effect occurs when rotor downwash reflects off the ground surface, creating
 *          a cushion of high-pressure air beneath the vehicle. This pressure increase
 *          causes barometric altimeters to report artificially low altitude readings
 *          (typically 0.5-2 meters error depending on vehicle size and hover height).
 *          
 *          Algorithm Overview:
 *          1. Detect imminent takeoff: Armed, landed, throttle commanded
 *          2. Detect active takeoff: Time since throttle up, altitude gained
 *          3. Detect imminent landing: Slow horizontal speed, controlled descent
 *          4. Signal EKF to apply appropriate barometer bias compensation
 *          
 *          Takeoff Detection Logic:
 *          - Monitors armed state with land_complete flag (on ground)
 *          - Tracks time since throttle application (5 second window)
 *          - Confirms takeoff when altitude increases >50cm from starting point
 *          - Excludes THROW mode which has unique ground release behavior
 *          
 *          Landing Detection Logic:
 *          - Requires slow horizontal motion (<1.25 m/s actual or <1.25 m/s commanded)
 *          - Requires slow descent (<1.0 m/s demanded or <0.6 m/s actual)
 *          - Validates small attitude angles (<7.5Â° from level in ALT_HOLD)
 *          - Combines velocity measurements with pilot/autopilot intent
 *          
 *          EKF Compensation Strategy:
 *          - set_takeoff_expected(): Reduces barometer weight during initial climb
 *          - set_touchdown_expected(): Prepares for pressure anomalies during descent
 *          - Allows EKF to estimate and remove ground effect barometer bias
 *          - Prevents altitude control oscillations and overshoot during landing
 *          
 *          State Machine Behavior:
 *          - takeoff_expected: true from armed+landed until 5s or 50cm altitude
 *          - touchdown_expected: true when slow+descending, false otherwise
 *          - Both states reset when disarmed or compensation disabled
 * 
 * @note Called at main loop rate (typically 400Hz for attitude control)
 * @note Requires g2.gndeffect_comp_enabled parameter to be active
 * @note Directly affects altitude hold performance within 1-2m of ground
 * 
 * @warning Ground effect compensation is safety-critical for:
 *          - Preventing hard landings due to altitude underestimation
 *          - Avoiding takeoff altitude oscillations
 *          - Maintaining stable hover at low altitude
 *          Improper detection can cause altitude control instability

 * @brief Update EKF terrain height stability flag for rangefinder-assisted altitude estimation
 * 
 * @details This function controls whether the EKF considers terrain height stable enough
 *          to use rangefinder measurements for improved altitude estimation during takeoff
 *          and landing. When enabled, the EKF can blend rangefinder data with barometric
 *          altitude to provide more accurate height-above-ground measurements that are
 *          less affected by barometric pressure variations and ground effect.
 *          
 *          Terrain Height Stable Concept:
 *          The "terrain height stable" flag tells the EKF that the ground surface beneath
 *          the vehicle is at a consistent, unchanging altitude. This assumption allows
 *          the EKF to use rangefinder (e.g., lidar, sonar) measurements to:
 *          - Stabilize barometric altitude estimates during pressure transients
 *          - Improve altitude accuracy when barometer is affected by ground effect
 *          - Provide better height control during takeoff and landing phases
 *          
 *          When Terrain is "Stable":
 *          - Vehicle taking off from flat surface (terrain not changing)
 *          - Vehicle landing on flat surface (terrain not changing)
 *          - Rangefinder can measure consistent height-above-ground
 *          
 *          When Terrain is NOT "Stable":
 *          - Normal flight over varying terrain
 *          - Position estimate unavailable (can't relate rangefinder to absolute altitude)
 *          - Terrain following where ground height is changing
 *          
 *          Implementation Note:
 *          This is NOT related to terrain following (TERRAIN_FOLLOW) which uses terrain
 *          database. This is purely about using rangefinder to stabilize EKF altitude
 *          estimation during phases when terrain height is known to be constant.
