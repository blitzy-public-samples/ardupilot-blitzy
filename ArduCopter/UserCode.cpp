/**
 * @file UserCode.cpp
 * @brief User extensibility hook system for ArduCopter
 * 
 * @details This file provides safe extension points for adding custom functionality
 *          to ArduCopter without modifying core flight code. User hooks are called
 *          from the main scheduler at different rates, allowing custom code to be
 *          executed at predictable intervals alongside normal flight operations.
 *          
 *          The hook system is designed to enable:
 *          - Custom sensor integration and processing
 *          - Additional telemetry and logging
 *          - Experimental flight algorithms
 *          - Hardware accessory control
 *          - Research and development features
 *          
 *          Each hook function is conditionally compiled based on preprocessor defines,
 *          allowing selective enabling of only needed functionality to minimize
 *          overhead and maintain deterministic timing.
 *          
 *          Hook System Architecture:
 *          - Hooks are called from the main scheduler (Copter.cpp scheduler_tasks)
 *          - Each hook has guaranteed execution frequency and timing budget
 *          - Hooks execute in the main thread context
 *          - All hooks must respect timing constraints to maintain flight stability
 *          
 * @note This is an ADVANCED feature - improper use can cause vehicle instability or crashes
 * @warning All user code must be non-blocking and complete within allocated time budget
 * @warning Modifying flight-critical state from hooks can compromise safety systems

 * 
 * @details This function is called once during vehicle initialization after

 *          - Initialize custom sensors or peripherals
 *          - Allocate resources needed by other user hooks
 *          - Configure custom hardware interfaces
 *          - Register custom MAVLink message handlers
 *          - Set up custom data structures
 *          
 *          Execution Context:
 *          - Called from Copter::init_ardupilot() during startup sequence
 *          - Executes before scheduler starts (no timing constraints)
 *          - Full access to all initialized vehicle subsystems

 *          
 *          Available Subsystems at Init Time:
 *          - HAL interfaces (Serial, SPI, I2C, GPIO)
 *          - Parameter system (AP_Param)
 *          - Logger (AP_Logger)
 *          - GCS communication (may not be fully connected)
 *          - Sensor drivers (already probed and initialized)
 *          
 * @note Enable by defining USERHOOK_INIT in APM_Config.h or via build flags

 *          - Can perform limited filesystem I/O if needed
 *          
 *          Common Patterns:

 *          - Aggregate data collection over multiple cycles
 *          - Slow state machine updates
 *          - Periodic parameter validation
 *          - Long-term trend analysis
