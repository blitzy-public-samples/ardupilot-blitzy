 * @file qautotune.cpp
 * @brief QuadPlane automatic tuning implementation for ArduPlane
 * 
 * @details This file implements the QAutoTune class which provides automatic
 *          tuning functionality for QuadPlane attitude controllers. It inherits
 *          from AC_AutoTune_Multi and adapts the multicopter autotuning algorithm
 *          for use in QuadPlane vehicles (fixed-wing aircraft with VTOL capabilities).
 *          
 *          The autotuning process optimizes PID controller parameters for roll,
 *          pitch, and yaw rate controllers by performing systematic test maneuvers
 *          and analyzing the vehicle's response characteristics.
 *          
 *          Key responsibilities:
 *          - Initialize autotuning mode with appropriate position hold behavior
 *          - Provide pilot input interfaces during tuning sequences
 *          - Configure vertical motion limits for safe tuning operations
 *          - Log PID performance data during tuning maneuvers
 *          
 * @note This implementation is conditionally compiled with QAUTOTUNE_ENABLED,
 *       typically available only in SITL (Software In The Loop) simulation
 *       unless explicitly enabled for hardware platforms.
 *       
 * @warning Autotuning performs aggressive maneuvers and should only be conducted
 *          with adequate altitude, in calm wind conditions, and with an experienced
 *          pilot ready to take manual control if needed.
 * 
 * @see AC_AutoTune_Multi for the base autotuning algorithm implementation
 * @see QuadPlane for the QuadPlane flight mode and control integration

/**
 * @brief Initialize QAUTOTUNE mode for QuadPlane automatic tuning
 * 
 * @details This method sets up the autotuning mode by verifying QuadPlane
 *          availability and initializing the internal autotuning state machine.
 *          It determines whether to use position hold based on the previous
 *          flight mode, enabling hover-in-place tuning if coming from QLOITER.
 *          
 *          Initialization sequence:
 *          1. Verify QuadPlane subsystem is available and functional
 *          2. Determine position hold requirement from previous mode
 *          3. Initialize autotuning internals with attitude and position controllers
 *          4. Configure AHRS view for attitude reference
 *          
 *          Position hold behavior:
 *          - Enabled if previous mode was QLOITER (maintains GPS position)
 *          - Disabled otherwise (allows manual positioning during tuning)
 * 
 * @return true if initialization successful and autotuning can proceed
 * @return false if QuadPlane unavailable or initialization failed
 * 
 * @note This is called automatically when entering QAUTOTUNE mode via mode switch
 * @note Requires functional QuadPlane with operational attitude and position controllers
 * 
 * @warning Initialization failure will prevent autotuning mode entry and return
 *          vehicle to previous flight mode for safety
 * 
 * @see AC_AutoTune_Multi::init_internals() for base initialization logic
 * @see QuadPlane::available() for QuadPlane availability check

 * @brief Get pilot's desired climb rate during autotuning
 * 
 * @details Retrieves the pilot's commanded vertical velocity from throttle
 *          stick input, allowing the pilot to maintain or adjust altitude

 *          QuadPlane's standard climb rate calculation, ensuring consistent
 *          behavior with normal VTOL flight modes.
 *          
 *          The climb rate is derived from:
 *          - Throttle stick position (center = 0 climb rate)
 *          - Configured climb rate limits (PILOT_SPEED_UP, PILOT_SPEED_DN)

 * 
 * @note This method is called continuously during autotuning to allow pilot

 *          
 *          Input processing logic:
 *          - If roll AND pitch sticks centered: Returns zero for both axes
 *            (allows autotuning algorithm full control of roll/pitch)
 *          - If either stick moved: Returns navigation controller attitude targets
 *            (allows pilot to reposition or correct attitude)
 *          - Yaw rate: Always derived from rudder stick input regardless of
 *            roll/pitch stick positions
 *          
 *          Coordinate frame: Body frame angles
 *          - Roll: Right-hand rule around forward axis (positive = right wing down)

 * @brief Initialize vertical axis speed and acceleration limits for autotuning

 *

 *          2. Correction limits (set_correction_speed_accel_U_cmss):
